				<p>It is with pleasure and pride that SCAHA, the Anaheim Ducks and Los Angeles Kings have selected each of you as one of three recipients of the Season 2013-2014 SCAHA Scholastic Financial Assistance Awards! You have demonstrated excellence in your academic endeavors, as well as your participation as a hockey player. We want to recognize your accomplishments, and ask you to consider appearing at the June SCAHA Board meeting on Wednesday June 11, at The Rinks-Lakewood. In conjunction with the Anaheim Ducks and Los Angeles Kings, we will be presenting an award of $1,500 each for your benefit to help offset your education goal expenses.</p>
