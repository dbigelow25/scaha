		<p:panel header="2014 Mite Program" footer="brought to you by iScaha">
					<p>SCAHA has recently decided the following for next season: 
		            <br /><br />
		            <ul>
		                <li>Follow USA Hockey’s ADM program by scheduling play only on reduced ice surfaces</li>      
		                <li>It is optional for teams to make their own decision to play up to 8 full ice games outside of 
		                SCAHA (ie. President’s Day tournament) starting after 1/1/15 </li>
		                <li>As with last season regarding “play up” allowances, the same guidelines apply: </li>
		                <ul>
		                    <li>Last year Mites (2006 birth year) will be permitted to play up in Squirts, as long as the player qualifies according to the player’s home Club standards</li>
		                    <li>No Squirt roster will contain more than 50% of Mite aged players (who qualify to play at the Squirt level based each Club’s own standards)</li>
		                </ul>
		            </ul>
		            Based on additional feedback from our recent survey, Club Presidents, Mite coaching staff members, Mite Coordinators, USA Hockey and many others, we are working on more favorable enhancements to the divisions of play and format of Cluster Events for next season. <br /><br />
		
		            We will be providing more detailed information to our member Clubs, as we head towards a new season of play. Thanks for your continued participation and support of our program</p>
