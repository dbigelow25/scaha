CAHA Youth Council and CAHA Board in regards to Tier scheduling.&nbsp; Previously 
sent out request for input prior to February CAHA meeting and did not receive a 
lot of response at that time.&nbsp; Sent out again, Pam is also working on proposal.&nbsp; 
Need to be able to go to Youth Council and CAHA Board and state that this is 
what the member clubs of SCAHA want.&nbsp; Need to know what the member clubs want in 
their CAHA state schedule.&nbsp; Tony distributed guideline, which he has been 
working on with Melissa Fitzgerald from Norcal. Pam Levin has also been working

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Pam Levin reviewed her 
proposal for CAHA scheduling.&nbsp; Proposal included overview of what is being 
proposed along with breakdown of cost and weekends.&nbsp; The cost sheet sent out 
previously included 17-minute periods and ice cut between 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> 
period.&nbsp; In order to bring down the cost have changed to 15-minute periods and 
eliminated ice cut.&nbsp; Based on number of teams this season, the season cost will 
be about $5,000. per team.&nbsp; This cost will be for 4 weekends, 3 in the South and 
1 in the North for a total of 16 games.&nbsp; General proposal has been approved by 
CAHA with caveat that the contact rinks are able to commit to program.&nbsp; Majority 
of rinks have responded that they are interested.&nbsp; Will be run similar to 
Southwest format, weekends will not be Southwest weekends, holidays, nor 
Silversticks or anything that would conflict with normal tournament play.&nbsp; No 
travel expenses are going to be paid to referees; over 60 referees have agreed 
to participate at the going rate.&nbsp; They will also serve as scorekeepers.&nbsp; In 
addition there will be no travel expenses for tournament directors.&nbsp; Will 
provide statistics and schedule through Sportability.&nbsp; Most games will be played 
Saturday and Sunday some games may be played on Friday evenings.&nbsp; Discussion 
followed regarding both proposals.&nbsp; </span></p>

welcome them into our schedule; 3. If they have more than 1 team we would travel 
up north.&nbsp; No specific motion made, but direction to follow.&nbsp; Request was made 
to have motion made.&nbsp; Tim Rodda moved to invite Norcal AA teams into our
