		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Robert Doherty

		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Bob read from an 
		email he received from Jerry Wilhite regarding the Crowchild tournament 
		teams’ invitation to participate in a tournament in Calgary, Canada over 
		the Easter weekend.&nbsp; Jerry is looking for support from SCAHA similar to 
		last years when 16 different clubs were represented on the team. The age 
		levels are one Squirt aged team and one Peewee aged team. The players 
		would wear a Socal-hockey jersey with the SCAHA patch and an embroidered 
		club patch on the sleeve (if approved by the club). Tryouts for the 
		teams will be the weekend of the 4<sup>th</sup> of February and 
		temporary releases will be required from the players.</span></p>

		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Bob read from 
		another email he received from Jerry Wilhite regarding a good deed 
		during a Christmas Tournament. Jerry commended the actions of the PW A 
		Stars coach Steve Corbett, a doctor, who upon learning of an injured 
		player in another game left his game bench to assist the player until 
		the paramedics arrived. He put the welfare of a child ahead of winning a 
		game, which is highly commendable.</span></p>

		<b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Las Vegas Report- 
		Memo from Bobby Burns:</span></b></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">Bob read a proposal by Bobby Burns that was 
		originally distributed to the SCAHA club presidents’ via email on 
		12/30/05. The proposal involved scheduling selected SCAHA games in Vegas 
		and combining them with games with Las Vegas teams in addition to the 
		SCAHA scheduled exhibition games played at Riverside. Lisa England asked 
		if LAHOA would be involved. Sandy answered only here in Socal. Some 
		discussion followed and it was decided to table this for the summer to 
		give the board more time to explore the options and discuss it with 
		their clubs.</p>

		<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Playoff Committee Volunteers:</b></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">Bob stated that at each venue site the SCAHA 
		Playoff committee would need to know who the host would be, whether it 
		will be the club or the rink. In addition, he will need a list of names 
		of those who will be responsible at each site as the go-to person. Laura 
		Ryan informed Bob that Larry Cahn and herself would be the parties 
		responsible at the Escondido venue for the Semis.</p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Sandy Blumberg 
		informed the board that the next round of the Disciplinary Review 
		Committee hearings is scheduled for January 19<sup>th</sup>. They will 
		be reviewing anywhere from five to ten hearings. Sandy stated that some 
		of the teams are approaching the penalty threshold for penalty minutes 
		for their level and the team head coaches will be invited to a hearing 
		as well as the top penalty minutes players. At this time there are three 
		(3) teams that have reached or who are close to reaching their 
		threshold. Sandy reminded the board that the penalty minute threshold 
		for Mites and Squirts is 275 minutes and for all other age divisions 400 
		minutes.</span></p>

		<p class="MsoBodyText">Annie stated that everyone should be receiving 
		their up to date game suspension reports and she will be emailing 
		everyone their up to date penalty minutes for their teams/clubs. 
		Currently there are three (3) teams that have exceeded 350 penalty 
		minutes and the rest are below 300 minutes.</p>

		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Annie informed the 
		board that she has not been receiving the game summary reports this past 
		weekend and it may be in part due to her computer. She suggested that 
		managers copy the game summary report directly into the email if they 
		are not receiving confirmation that their summary was sent and received 
		by Annie. Chris Carcerano stated that it was probably related to a spam

		REPORT</span></u></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Chris Carcerano 
		opened the discussion regarding the 17 game season schedule for odd 
		numbered divisions where historically only 16 games count and how some 
		teams/divisions fall short of that due to playing the exhibition teams 
		(e.g. Cal Selects) multiple times.&nbsp; Some suggestions that were discussed 
		proposed adding 4 to 5 games to those teams so that they end up playing 
		a total of 16 games. An exception to this would be the Peewee B division 
		where 15 games would count towards the standings. In the past, for those 
		odd numbered divisions, a number representing the SCAHA weekends would 
		be randomly drawn from a hat and that weekend of play would be thrown 
		out for all the teams in that division. It was felt that adding a game 
		might skew the entire division and most were in agreement to leave the 
		process as is- having 16 games count towards the standings.</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Bob Doherty asked 
		what the status of the schedule was. Chris reported that the following 
		games would be scheduled by SCAHA if he does not receive consensus from 
		both teams regarding a date, time and venue by the deadline of January 
		14, 2006. Following games still need to be played:</span></p>
