		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Sandy Blumberg 
		informed the board of an individual’s (parent/coach) request to expand 
		the Bantam A division from 8 teams to 10 teams. She stated that the 
		request was not a formal appeal and that the Executive Board only 
		entertained discussion on it as a courtesy to the member club. 
		Unfortunately, the member club presidents during rules discussions prior 
		to the season’s start should formally make requests such as these.
		</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">

		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Sandy recommended 
		that presidents should attend the various venues hosting the playoffs so 
		as to make it a professional and wonderful experience for all. She 
		presented to the board the new SCAHA Playoff pin and water glass with 
		the 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary logo on them. The pins sell for $3.00 
		each and the water glasses sell for $5.00 each.</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Sandy stated to the 
		board that SCAHA is still finding assistant coaches (that have been 
		removed from the bench for lack of proper coaching certification levels 
		by 12-31-2004), coaching games during regular season. There is a CAHA 
		policy in place to deal with these issues and clubs are obliged to 
		conform to the rules.</span></p>

		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">SCAHA Playoff Rules:</span></u></b></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">Sandy handed out a summary and gave a quick 
		overview of the playoff rules. There will be a one- (1) minute time out 
		for each game. During round robin play, if the game ends with a tie 
		during regulation play, there will be up to two 5-minute overtime 
		periods. In semi finals and championship games there will also be two 
		5-minute overtime periods followed by a shoot out.</p>

		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">SCAHA Playoff Rules:</span></u></b></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">Sandy advised the board of the Inappropriate 
		Behavior Rule new for this year’s playoffs. She stated that Tony Romo, 
		SCAHA Playoff Committee Chair together with Sandy were going to call 
		every coach at the Bantam and Midget level prior to the start of 
		playoffs to remind them of the new rule that was distributed to all the 
		club presidents and registrars by email.</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">The club presidents were reminded that Zero 
		Tolerance would be in effect for these games for all participants and 
		spectators. SCAHA suspensions must be served during the playoffs only 
		and not during exhibition or tournament play. Coaches are responsible 
		for certifying the score sheets with regards to the players present and 
		must sign all score sheets. Parents and coaches are to speak to the 
		SCAHA representative on site regarding any issue. They will not be 
		allowed to approach the referees before or after any game.</p>

		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Wendy Goldstein

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The question was 
		asked if a ‘problem parents list’- those that violated the Zero

		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<h2>Time-Out Rule for next season:</h2>
		<p class="MsoNormal">Larry Cahn stated that he would like to see a time 
		out rule implemented for next season. Sandy stated that now is the time 
		to be reviewing rules and possibly coming up with proposals for new 
		rules to be implemented and/or modified for next season. The Rules 
		committee will be meeting at the end of April and those that are 
		interested in sitting on the committee should indicate so by the April 
		board of directors’ meeting.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><u>
		<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial">NEW BUSINESS 
		(Cont’d)</span></u></b></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText2">Larry Cahn motioned for SCAHA to provide a full 
		Tier II schedule for next season. Laura Ryan seconded it. Discussions 
		followed. Rosemary Voulelikas stated that CAHA will be providing a 
		Midget Tier II schedule for next season and has designated four weekends 
		for the divisions. The games scheduled during these weekends will not be 
		rescheduled by CAHA due to conflicts and would deem a team post-season 
		ineligible should they decide not to honor the schedule. In other words 
		teams are not permitted to opt out of this schedule for any reason 
		including SWYHL or SCAHA. Rosemary also stated that there was some 
		discussion regarding CAHA designating these weekends for the Peewee and 
		Bantam Tier II divisions as the weekends where the teams must play 
		California teams in order to meet their 100% CAHA playing rule 
		requirement. Rosemary stated that it would be difficult for SCAHA to 
		schedule a full schedule with these four weekends already taken by CAHA. 
		Larry amended his motion to have the SCAHA Tier II schedule to take in 
		account these CAHA weekends. Alex Dunaev seconded it. More discussions 
		followed. Sandy stated that the SCAHA rule 26.08- 26.11 allows for 
		flexibility in rescheduling and as it stands SCAHA has no ‘teeth” to 
		ensure that games will not be rescheduled by the Tier teams as was 
		indicated this season as well as last season. Bob Doherty called for a 
		vote on the motion and clarified the voting. A No vote indicates that 
		the motion is to be tabled for further discussion and a Yes vote 
		indicates approval for a full schedule. Nine (9) voted yes and eight (8) 
		voted no with 1 abstention. <b>The MOTION CARRIED.</b></p>

		<h3><u>OLD BUSINESS</u></h3>
		<h4>Carmen Starr Scholarship:</h4>
		<p class="MsoBodyText2">Lisa England reported that the committee met and 
		formalized the forms and requirements. She stated that she would present 
		at the next SCAHA Board of Director’s meeting.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<h4>Playoff Committee Report:</h4>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Tony Romo reiterated 
		Sandy’s summary of the issue regarding expanding the Bantam A division. 
		Bay Harbor representatives stated that they were not in support of this 
		request and that the club would not file a formal request. Mariners also 
		stated that they would not file any formal appeal and they too were fine 
		with the existing rules.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Joe Francis 
		(individual coach who instigated the informal request) interjected that 
		SCAHA has violated its own rules by allowing the Jr. Ducks and the 
		Riptide teams to reschedule a game where no formal appeal was made to do 
		so. By having that game replayed it changed the standings and his team 
		the Bantam A Red Wings ended up just shy of making playoffs. At this 
		point, the Commissioner stopped Mr. Francis and informed him that he did 
		not have any legal right to bring up this issue and only the club 
		president and/or his designated representative can file a formal appeal. 
		He directed Mr. Francis to file with his club first. Heated discussions 
		followed and Kevin Culbertson motioned to adjourn the meeting. Lisa 
		seconded it. <b>MOTION CARRIED.</b></span></p>
