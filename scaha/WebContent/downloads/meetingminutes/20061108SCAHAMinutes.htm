		the process, how they create the storyboard, player profiles, head shots 
		of players, interviews, game segments, etc. They provide the anchors for 
		the segment. Any team/club that is interested would need to commit to 
		two shows. The cost of producing one show is $2000/show and they throw 
		in a third one. They also have the possibility of private purchase for 
		non-airing shows called “Scout’s corner.” If interested you can email

		Diego Saints, the Artesia Avalanche and the San Diego Ice Arena. He 
		reminded the board that it is during the December meeting that the board 
		votes on whether to lift their probation and since the board just voted 
		not to hold a December board meeting, the board will have to vote at 
		this meeting. Laura Ryan motioned to have the San Diego Saint’s

		<h2>DEPUTY COMMISSIONER’S REPORT</h2>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Sandy Blumberg 
		reported there were nine Disciplinary Review hearings conducted that 
		dealt mostly with parents being ejected. Sandy Blumberg asked the 
		presidents to remind their managers that at the moment the 
		parents/spectators are ejected the 30-day suspension is in effect and 
		they must leave the rink. In addition, managers must be familiar of the 
		following specific rules:</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Sandy Blumberg 
		reviewed the number of playoff berths. In the past, if the division had 
		10 teams then 8 teams would go to playoffs. In September, prior to final 
		declarations, we changed that to state if the division has 12 teams or 
		more then 8 teams go to playoffs. There are three divisions with less 
		than 12 teams and two of these divisions will be effected by this rule. 
		The Mite A has only four teams and all four teams will go to playoffs. 
		This is stated in the new rule, and this is fine. The Peewee B and the 
		Bantam B each have 11 teams and with the current ruling only six teams 
		will go to playoffs. Sandy Blumberg wanted to be sure that this was the 
		intent of the board when it voted in the new rule. David Peterson 
		motioned to amend the playoff rule to state that 8 teams will go to 
		playoffs in divisions with 10 teams or more. Kevin Culbertson seconded.

		<h1><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">MEMBER SERVICES REPORT</span></h1>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">Wendy Goldstein distributed a SCAHA player fee 
		chart indicating the amounts paid and balances outstanding per club. In 
		addition, Wendy informed the board that there are many coaches appearing 
		on score sheets who have not been rostered on teams. Bob Doherty stated 
		if this practice continues clubs will be fined $100 for each ineligible 
		coach that appears on a score sheet. If in addition, the coach has not 
		been screened then the problem comes under the jurisdiction of CAHA and 
		not SCAHA. The CAHA president is looking at removing a coach’s 
		certification for a year as a penalty. Wendy Blumberg stated she would 
		be emailing a list of coaches who appeared on score sheets last week and 
		who are not rostered on teams.</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">Wendy Blumberg advised the board of the following

		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">ICE CONVENER REPORT</span></u></b></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">Chris Carcerano informed the presidents he made 
		an error when he scheduled four (4) AA games on Saturday, Dec. 16, 2006. 
		This was not intentional. The games will need to be rescheduled and he 
		is asking for the teams to reschedule them since he has already given 
		back the unused ice slots to the clubs. Chris Carcerano added that there 
		is also one Midget A16U that will need rescheduling- the Lightning vs. 
		the Riptides. Chris Carcerano stated he takes full responsibility for 
		these errors (scheduling games during the SCAHA Pre-Select Camp), but in 
		all fairness, he did ask the clubs not to provide Saturday ice slots.</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">Chris Carcerano reiterated that there are some 
		girls’ games that have mandatory byes (CAHA Mandated weekends), one of 
		which is this weekend, weekend #10. This game needs to be rescheduled 
		for a different weekend. He would like the details of the date and time 
		by Nov. 14, 2006. He believes it is a Lady Ducks game but is not sure at 
		this time. The rescheduling process involves providing Chris Carcerano 
		with the date, time and he will schedule it and finalize it to make sure 
		it is fair to both teams. Bob Doherty added that as with the Tier II 
		games that need rescheduling, teams must submit the details of the 
		rescheduled game 30 days from the date of the original scheduled game.</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">In addition, Chris Carcerano reminded the board 
		that there are eight (8) girls’ games from week #16, this is the January 
		14<sup>th</sup> weekend, which requires rescheduling. The deadline for 
		submitting the details of the date and time of the rescheduled games is 
		by Nov. 22, 2006. </p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">And finally, Chris Carcerano informed the board 
		that there are eight (8) games from the March 4<sup>th</sup> weekend

		details will be Dec. 8, 2006.</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
		<h2>STATISTICIAN REPORT</h2>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">Annie Fisher reported on the suspension list that 
		just went out this week to all the clubs. She stated that so far this 
		season there have been about 435 suspensions. The penalty minute totals 
		to date were also distributed to the clubs via email this week. She is 
		happy to report she is receiving the score sheets in a timely manner and 
		appreciates all the managers’ efforts.</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><u>TREASURER’S REPORT</u></b></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">Bob Driffill distributed the financials dated 
		September 30, 2006 to the board. He stated the Net Income for the month 
		of September was $46,000 and YTD (year-to-date) about $44,000. The check 
		registry is also included as well as the monthly nets that give you an 
		idea how we are doing month to month. And finally, the SCAHA team fees 
		per club collected are also included with the financials.</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">Rosemary Voulelikas asked if the SCAHA player 
		fees are collected for the girls’ teams. Wendy Goldstein stated that 
		they are but they are lumped together with their respective clubs. Wendy 
		then prepares a spreadsheet showing the divisions between youth and 
		girls’ teams.</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">LeAnn Doherty reported on behalf of Laurie Boaz, 
		who had to leave unexpectantly, that the scholarship letters would be 
		mailed in November to the awardees and the checks would be mailed in 
		December. Paula Frankel asked what the average amount awarded was. LeAnn 
		Doherty answered that they were from $100 to $500 and 102 applications 
		were received and 24 clubs were represented.</p>
