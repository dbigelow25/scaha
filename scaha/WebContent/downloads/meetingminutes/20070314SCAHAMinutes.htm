		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Bob Doherty informed 
		the board that Mike Callahan would be appealing the Disciplinary Review 
		Committee’s decision resulting from a hearing conducted on March 5, 2007 
		to the full SCAHA board. Mike Callahan is asking the board to reduce his 
		30-day suspension to 15-days to match those of his players. Sandy 
		Blumberg summarized the findings for the board. A video of the CAHA 
		State playoff game Jr. Kings MDAA16U vs San Jose Jr. Sharks was played 
		for the board. Mike Callahan was suspended for 30 days beginning 
		September 1, 2007 as a result of the incidents that occurred during this 
		playoff game. </span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Sandy Blumberg read 
		a prepared statement from the Disciplinary Committee. <i>“ The decision 
		to suspend coach Callahan was based on the following. The players on the 
		team behaved in a way that was both embarrassing and detrimental. They 
		committed these acts during a CAHA state playoff game. The coach should 
		have been aware that the frustration level of the players had escalated 
		to a point that there was a reasonable chance that there would be an 
		incident at the end of the game. Players engaged in fighting violated 
		the USA Hockey code of conduct. … Coach Callahan should have been aware 
		of CAHA rule 7.5 which deals with the sanctions assessed when players 
		leave the bench during an altercation.</i> …<i>”</i></span></p>
