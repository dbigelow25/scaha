<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Sandy reported that the 
playoffs had an outstanding turnout at the Long Beach Ice Arena.&nbsp; Feedback has 
been good from those that were able to attend and participate.&nbsp; The round robin 
went fairly smooth.&nbsp; Some bumps in the road, Oxnard roof collapse, which caused 
games to be moved.&nbsp; There were 2 serious penalties, which occurred during the 
round robin, hearings were held at the semi-finals and the semi-finals went off 
extremely well in Lakewood.&nbsp; 1 fairly serious injury which resulted in 1 parent 
being suspended 30 days from SCAHA as a result of throwing beer at a bench at 
the conclusion of the Midget A17 game at the Long Beach Ice Arena.&nbsp; He has been 
suspended for 30 days because that was the maximum that could be given without 
holding a hearing and with the CAHA finals looming.&nbsp; CAHA has since been asked 
to review the penalty and extend.&nbsp; </span></p>

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Dave Monshaw commented on 
the parking fees, that at the last meeting it was stated that there would be no 
charge for parking.&nbsp; Sandy replied that at the last meeting Tony had stated that 
he was trying to work with the city regarding a fee waiver.&nbsp; The city would not 
grant the waiver.&nbsp; Sandy stated that of all the complaints received (were only 
few complaints,) none were regarding the parking fees.&nbsp; The Ice Arena was very 
accommodating and was thrilled to have the playoffs.&nbsp; The kids had a great time.</span></p>

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Tony introduced David 
Bigelow of the Yorba Linda Ice Palace, in affiliation with the Aliso Viejo Ice 
Palace.&nbsp; They are petitioning to become a member of SCAHA for the upcoming 2003 
– 2004 season.&nbsp; The team name will be Yorba Linda Blackhawks.&nbsp; They are 
projecting that they will have 5 to 6 teams within the Mite through Bantam 
range.&nbsp; It was stated that if passed the club would be on probation for the 
first year.&nbsp; Tony reminded everyone that the probation status can be removed by 
December by the SCAHA Executive Board and the teams would be eligible to 
participate in playoffs if all other requirements are met.</span></p>

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Bob Doherty inquired 
regarding Block Recruitment.&nbsp; This year the block recruitment was handled from 
President to President, will that be handled the same way next season.&nbsp; Tony 
stated these rules would need to be addressed. At the beginning of the year the 
Presidents wanted to handle amongst themselves.&nbsp; After a few different occasions 
of it happening it didn’t seem like it was a good idea.&nbsp; The rule will need to 
be revisited.&nbsp; </span></p>

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Jerry Wilhite inquired 
status of the Brick team and Team LA, they have been advertising that they have 
a CAHA number and as of today they don’t.&nbsp; They are not a CAHA approved club.&nbsp; 
It was stated that the rink has a CAHA number and that they may have aligned it 
with the rink.&nbsp; Jerry replied that yes, the Westminster rink has a number but 
Team LA does not.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">In the past the Brick team 
has been a team represented basically by the league affiliated all star team, 
which at that time was the Kings, who have disbanded.&nbsp; If they don’t have a CAHA 
number, how are they representing Southern California Hockey in the Brick 
Tournament?&nbsp; Tony stated that the first he had heard about them being sanctioned 
by CAHA was today.&nbsp; The Brick Tournament is 1<sup>st</sup> year Squirt and 2<sup>nd</sup> 
year Mites held in Edmonton, a big tournament that the league every year was 
sending a team to participate.&nbsp; Tryouts were held and special team was 
selected.&nbsp; Tony made contact this year with the tournament director, their 
agreement in the tournament is with Andy Cohen and with the team that Andy 
brings.&nbsp; The kids are competitive, the parents are well behaved and the coaches 
do a good job so they had already made the agreement with Andy for this year so 
they were going to honor that agreement.&nbsp; These agreements are for 3-year 
commitment.&nbsp; This is the 3<sup>rd</sup> year of that commitment for Andy.&nbsp; He 
just wants to be sure he gets competitive well-behaved players, coaches and 
parents.&nbsp; The tournament director was notified that Andy wasn’t representing the 
league anymore but he was representing another independent team within the 
league and the tournament director was not concerned with that.&nbsp; Next year they 
would be willing to open it up and receive input from the league.&nbsp; Next year he 
said SCAHA could apply and they would make a decision whether SCAHA would be 
selected to send a representative team. Jerry stated that people need to know 
that this is not a league-affiliated team. We need to state to SCAHA members 
that this years’ Brick tournament is not affiliated with the SCAHA league.&nbsp; 
Members perceive it as a league affiliated club and if they have issues or 
internal problems the league will not have any responsibility over it.&nbsp; It was 
also suggested that SCAHA should make a statement that Team LA is an independent 
organization.&nbsp; There are others also putting together special teams that SCAHA 
is not affiliated with.&nbsp; Statement has previously been put up on the website 
stating that the teams are not affiliated with SCAHA.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Curt distributed and 
reviewed the current Balance Sheet and Profit &amp; Loss.&nbsp; Profit &amp; Loss is from 
7/01 to 4/09.&nbsp; Within budget have some additional expenses for the playoffs that 
haven’t yet been received including ice bills.&nbsp; Banner, trophies and patches 
have all been paid.&nbsp; Also distributed for review (as per request of Valerie at 
the last meeting,) the listing of checks and deposits run through the SCAHA 
accounts since July.&nbsp; Also distributed for review was the listing of the 4 bank 
accounts from the period 1998 – 2002.&nbsp; These 4 bank accounts were opened during 
1998 – 2002, money that was not accounted for in the tax returns during the 
4-year period.&nbsp; That is the issue before the Board today. A print out was passed 
around of the same four year period for what was then called the Tier I budget 
line item in the SCAHA account that were reported in the tax returns.&nbsp; </span>

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Renewal was received in the 
mail for the D&amp;O insurance in the amount of $450.&nbsp; Spoke with the insurance 
company, we are in good standing and we will be renewing trying to raise the 
limit from 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 for an additional $150.&nbsp; We will have the same 
crime policy as last year, which is another $130.&nbsp; Update on the accounting 
situation, as stated in last months meeting there would be a need for additional 
expenses to go through the four years and reconcile with the IRS.&nbsp; Another 
engagement letter was received to go to the next process for the four years 
(98-02)&nbsp; $5,700 to reconcile those tax returns and approximately another $2,700 
to have them escort us through the appeal process with the IRS.&nbsp; Last month an 
increase in the accounting budget of $5,000. was approved.&nbsp; We are about $3,300 
below budget, requesting that it be raised about another $5,000 just to get 
through the process.&nbsp; The accounting process still hasn’t been reconciled with 
the IRS nor with the legal advisors.&nbsp; Further discussion followed regarding the 
best way to proceed legally.&nbsp; Curt stated that he did speak with the Risk 
Manager with USA Hockey.&nbsp; His only suggestion was to make sure that D&amp;O 
insurance is valid and that there is a clause in the USA Hockey guide, which he 
recommend that we evaluate, that basically indemnifies any volunteer, that is a 
member organization of SCAHA if they were to do something on their team and how 
they manage money, it would indemnify the league.&nbsp; This is something we may want 
to evaluate and have the attorney review along with our bylaws.&nbsp; Question was 
asked if any money had been budgeted for legal fees.&nbsp; At this time no monies 
have been budgeted for legal fees.&nbsp; The additional $5,000 being requested at 
this point is for the accounting fees.&nbsp; We may want to add at least $5,000 for 
legal retainer fees.&nbsp; Bob Doherty moved to amend budget by $15,000, $5,000 for 
accounting and $10,000 for attorney fees.&nbsp; Discussion followed regarding the 
need for legal assistance.&nbsp; There is concern regarding the protection of the 
non-profit status and need for representative with meeting with the IRS.&nbsp; The 
Executive Committee will interview candidates and report back to the board.&nbsp; <b>

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Copy of letter from Bobby 
Burns – Las Vegas Outlaws was distributed.&nbsp; Bobby reviewed the letter.&nbsp; The 1<sup>st</sup> 
paragraph is to say thank you for what SCAHA has done for the Outlaws.&nbsp; The 2<sup>nd</sup> 
paragraph discusses why they prefer to stay Exhibition status.&nbsp; They have 
concerns that if they were to have a team advance to playoffs that would involve 
more weekends than they prefer to travel.&nbsp; The 3<sup>rd</sup> paragraph again 
relates to less travel due to the fact that they would have to travel to all the 
rinks versus just Riverside.&nbsp; The last paragraph again discusses playoffs, last 
year there were issues and that if they advance to the playoffs they could knock 
out a SCAHA team from going to States.&nbsp; It was also discussed last year that the 
scheduling would be too difficult.&nbsp; The Outlaws paid last year $4,000 extra to 
pay for scheduling.&nbsp; This year they are proposing that they would like to still 
participate as an exhibition team, pay for the ice and have the visiting team 
pay for referees and not pay $4,000 for scheduling.&nbsp; They would still pay $27. 
registration fee for player.&nbsp; They would like to be voting member; they feel 
that the decisions made affect them.&nbsp; They just want to be excluded from the 
playoffs and having to participate every weekend.&nbsp; </span></p>

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Larry Bruyere moved to allow 
Las Vegas Outlaws to play as they have for the last 2 years in Riverside paying 
for the ice, while we pay for the officials and be allowed to become a voting 
member and pay registration fee of $35. for each player.&nbsp; MOTION WAS SECONDED.&nbsp; 
Discussion followed regarding just admitting them into the league, have the 
games count and be playoff eligible.&nbsp; Bobby stated that at their last board 
meeting it was decided it would be best for them to stay exhibition, some of the 
teams do not want to travel as much.&nbsp; They could come down 3-4 times, because 
they are not obligated to play everyone in each division as exhibition.&nbsp; If they 
are in the league and have to play in the playoffs, would create too many 
weekends of obligation. They are unable to come down and play every weekend.&nbsp; 
Question was brought forth as to reason for requesting voting privilege.&nbsp; 
Response was that the Outlaws Board felt that the decisions made by the SCAHA 
Board also affect the Outlaws.&nbsp; If it’s an issue they can remove that part of 
their request.&nbsp; Larry amended his motion to two motions.&nbsp; </span></p>

that if you are a voting member then you are a member club and not an exhibition 
club.&nbsp; The rules can be amended if necessary. Discussion followed of the proper 
procedure to change the rule.&nbsp; It was determined that there would need to be a 
change to the bylaws.&nbsp; Tony stated that he would squash the motion as per Curt’s 
request.&nbsp; It needs to be presented to the Executive Committee a minimum of 30 
days prior to any vote to adopt said proposal.&nbsp; It will need to be presented in 
writing, then reviewed by the Executive Committee and then voted at the

delinquency list information has been forwarded to Registrars and Club 
Presidents.&nbsp; All letters should be out to delinquent families.&nbsp; If you are 
rolling over any from the previous year, send an additional letter and notify 
Wendy.&nbsp; Needs to have by mid April, so delinquency list can be distributed to 
the clubs the 1<sup>st</sup> week in May, weekly updates will follow.&nbsp; Will need 
to notify of when players have cleared, just make sure not to clear until the

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Tony stated that special 
teams and summer programs are starting.&nbsp; There is some vagueness to the rule to 
tryout for a team.&nbsp; Based on the rulebook you cannot try out for a team and get 
a release for a tryout, we have been having you guys write letters that allow 
the kids to go tryout before May 1<sup>st</sup>.&nbsp; We need to work on this in the 
rules for next year.&nbsp; We have been getting a lot of questions.&nbsp; Wendy stated 
that she has been accepting emails from clubs which list the different programs 
a player is going to try out for, as long as it says the players name and that 
their financially clear from the club and they send Wendy a copy, she has been 
using that as the temporary release for just this part of the season if they are 
finished with playoffs.&nbsp; The issue was brought forth, that some of these special 
teams are not requesting releases from the players prior to the May 1<sup>st</sup>.&nbsp; 
After May 1<sup>st</sup> they don’t need a release, but the delinquency list 
needs to be checked.&nbsp; The agreement is that if they have a delinquency, you 
don’t let them on the ice.&nbsp; The release right now is allowing you to put them on 
the ice and we are saying that they are paid up with us.&nbsp; Question was posed 
that some special teams are not requesting the releases, are there repercussions 
for the teams not requesting temporary releases from the players?&nbsp; At this time 
there is no penalty for this and it does need to be addressed.&nbsp; If you know that 
one of your players who are delinquent is skating with one of these special 
teams, contact USA Hockey and they will remove them from the roster until they 
are free and clear.&nbsp; Tony requested volunteers for the rules committee; they 
will sit on the committee to make recommendations to make amendments to the 
rulebook.&nbsp; </span></p>

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Jerry Wilhite reported the 
nominations for the CAHA Board are upcoming.&nbsp; There are 10 member nominations 
for the board effective April 1<sup>st</sup>.&nbsp; There will be 10 positions 
available on the Board.&nbsp; It is important to make sure that there is 
representation from Southern California that will support Southern California 
hockey.&nbsp; Jerry distributed a current listing of the board indicating which terms 
were coming up.&nbsp; Let Jerry know if there is anyone interested in running.&nbsp; 
Strongly suggest that we get 6-8 people that will have SCAHA interest and the 
interest of our kids in Southern California.&nbsp; President is voted on by the CAHA 
board, but we need to come up with a list of people and put our votes to work 
the best way to represent us throughout the year.&nbsp; </span></p>

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Tony reported that the 
Executive Committee met after the last meeting and decided that it would be 
necessary to suspend one person indefinitely and accept the resignation of 
another individual.&nbsp; The purpose of the suspension was to protect the board.&nbsp; 
The investigation is still ongoing. Jerry stated that there are two issues, you 
have one with one person who was directly involved and another issue with a 
person who says that they weren’t directly involved, but you have emails that 
show they were directly involved in a supervisory capacity.&nbsp; Based on the 
information that was presented the decision was made unanimously.&nbsp; </span></p>

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">CAHA is looking for the 
SCAHA Board to ratify this so that they can process it.&nbsp; The Executive Board has 
asked that CAHA uphold the decision.&nbsp; USA Hockey isn’t going to deal with it 
until CAHA deals with it and CAHA will not go forward until we ratify it as a 
board.&nbsp; Curt stated that the message that needs to go to CAHA is that the full 
board acknowledge and ratifies the suspension and the resignation.&nbsp; Tony stated 
that the resignation received was accepted and acknowledged by the Executive 
Board.&nbsp; The resignation stated that he would no longer participate as a Board 
Member, a Manager, or any role with fiduciary responsibility.&nbsp; Discussion 
followed regarding the definition of indefinite suspension, indefinite was to 
give time for the accountants to complete review and for attorneys to advise on 
best way to proceed. Mike Jolicouer moved to ratify decision made by SCAHA 
Executive Board decision on suspension.&nbsp; <b>MOTION WAS SECONDED AND MOVED.</b></span></p>
