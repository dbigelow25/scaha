COMMISSIONER’S REPORT</u></b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Tony 
reported changes to CAHA rules. Biggest change is tryout dates will be moved 
next year (2004/2005.) Players will no longer sign score sheets, only coaches 
will be required to sign as to who is present. STOP patches will be required. 
CAHA will not be paying for the STOP patches. Carmen Starr moved to have league 
pay for STOP patches. <b>MOTION WAS SECONDED AND CARRIED. </b></font>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">100% 
rule for Tier II teams. All teams must play each other. Norcal is willing to 
come down here and play us and more than happy to host our teams up north. They 
are real receptive to working with us and they want to participate in the 
league, they are willing to pay the SCAHA membership fee to be included in the 
schedule and they’re looking at about 2 maybe 3 teams at every division. </font>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Tony 
inquired if any changes want to be made to the 25% Block Recruitment rule, the 
way the rule was enforced last year, waived off by some of the clubs. Discussion 
followed regarding the Block Recruitment rule and the waiving of the rule. Lisa 
England moved to follow rule 22.01 in SCAHA Guidebook and for anything over the 
limit, requests for exception must be provided in writing to the Executive Board 
and the Executive Board would make the final decision. <b>MOTION WAS SECONDED 
AND CARRIED. </b></font><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Tony 
reminded everyone that the sibling rule was put into effect this year for the 
02/03 season. Wanted to confirm the interpretation of applying this year would 
also affect any players or siblings who were put on the list in the 01/02 
season. Will we have a time limit on how far to go back? It was decided that if 
monies are owed then there would not be a time limit as to how far to go back.</font><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">One 
rule that would like to see changed for next year, is putting time frames on 
decisions. Cannot let these things drag out, whether we put a 2 or 3 week 
written response. Some requests took a few months last season. Further 
discussion followed, if club or league does not respond in a timely manner, do 
we want to leave as is or impose some type of penalty. Sandy stated that rule 
committee would come up with recommendation for next meeting. </font>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Curt 
recommended that the CAHA changes be posted on the SCAHA website and Club 
Presidents pass onto club members so that members are informed prior to tryouts.</font><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Tony 
stated that he wanted to put together a committee to work with Dave Monshaw. 
Dave stated that he feels that the success of the ice convenor job is going to 
depend a lot on participation by the member clubs. To smooth the transition, he 
is requesting some assistance in putting together a calendar. Would like to 
introduce milestones into the calendar. Curt Castagna recommended that draft of 
plan be put together by next meeting, so that by the time declarations are made 
we have something moving forward that not only incorporates black out weekends, 
holidays, Southwest, Exhibition, maybe some consideration to other competing 
things such as NARCH Winternationals. Try to remove the perception that we are 
not trying to improve.</font><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Tony 
stated that we need to formally ratify Dave Monshaw as the Ice Convenor for the 
2003/2004 season. Ron White moved to ratify Dave Monshaw as Ice Convenor. <b>
MOTION WAS SECONDED AND CARRIED.</b> </font><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Lisa 
England inquired if the SCAHA schedule is going to allow for the Southwest 
League. Last year there were problems with games not being played or being 
rescheduled. How will this play out in the schedule this year, as far as for 
allotting for the Southwest League? Jerry Wilhite responded that in years past, 
notice was given up front that you were in the Southwest League and those 
weekends were blocked out and the Board voted on Southwest League being blocked 
or other times you knew you were going to be out of town for other tournaments 
that you would state that you don’t have a team available that weekend and they 
would work it into other weekends. Curt Castagna replied that another issue 
would be making sure clubs have the allocated ice to support home games. One of 
the toughest parts of Dave’s job is to make sure the ice is allocated for the 
schedule to work. Jerry stated that if you only have two clubs giving Saturday 
ice, there is going to be a problem. Tony stated that if clubs have the Saturday 
ice, please give so that games can be scheduled. If you have weeknight ice, 
might be able to utilize if good time and local teams. Would help out the 
schedule. </font><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Curt 
reported that the Chicago Showcase was in our budget for $2,850. to provide 
scholarships for the players on the team. Unsure if any of those players were 
SCAHA players or Tier I players playing outside the league. The decision needs 
to be made how we want to distribute the money to the players. Jerry Wilhite 
moved to distribute the money to each rostered Southern California player who 
was on the team. <b>MOTION WAS SECONDED AND CARRIED.</b></font><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>

needs to be posted on each clubs website, and the SCAHA site will link to each 
club page.</font><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>

GUESTS</u></b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">James 
Parker of LAHOA Board was present to touch base with clubs. They have heard that 
some of the clubs are interested in or are considering centralized scheduling. 
Wanted to let everyone know that LAHOA Board is against that proposal. Concerned 
about putting all of the scheduling into one’s persons hand. Ben Cohen inquired 
if there was going to be an increase in fees. Reply was that has not been 
discussed yet. Most likely will be discussed at next meeting. LAHOA annual 
meeting is 6/30/03.</font><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>

DEPUTY COMMISSIONER’S REPORT</u></b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Sandy 
reported that the Letter of Intents must be distributed at the next meeting. 
Reminded everyone that the SCAHA guidebook is a two-year book, so any rules or 
revisions that the Rules Committee comes up with will be an addendum to the 
guidebook. The rules are online and reach a majority of the membership. Would 
like to propose that we make the Letter of Intent a dual form, a Letter of 
Intent/Rule Form and require that everyone use. Would like to include a box on 
the form, which states that the SCAHA rules are available online at </font>
<font face="Verdana" color="#0000ff" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.scaha.com"><u>

and in the event that you should not have access your club will provide you with 
a copy. We will provide to each club 20 black and white stapled copies to hand 
out to players who request it because they have no online access. In addition 
the conditions of membership will be on the back of the Letter of Intent. </font>
