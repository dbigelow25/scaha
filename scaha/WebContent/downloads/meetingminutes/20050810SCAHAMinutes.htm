		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Bob Doherty informed 
		the board that the Block recruitment rule is a rule requested by the

		team, the SCAHA Executive Committee voted to grant the waiver. Bob 
		informed the board that both Louis and Rosemary excused themselves from 
		voting.</span></p>

		<p class="MsoBodyText">Bob stated that SCAHA continues to receive 
		complaints regarding violation of the recruitment rules 17.03 and 17.04 
		of the SCAHA Rules and Regulations. Allegations of recruitment 
		violations must be submitted in writing by the parent and/or player in 
		order for SCAHA to be able to enforce the rule. It is very difficult for 
		SCAHA to enforce it without these attestations in writing. </p>

		<h2>DEPUTY COMMISSIONER REPORT</h2>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Sandy informed the 
		board she was working closely with Chris Carcerano in developing online 
		SCAHA forms. She talked about the SCAHA Game Summary form and how they 
		were looking to update it with possible comment section for the coaches 
		to evaluate the refs. She also talked about developing another form for 
		referees to use that would give more details about games.</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Wendy Goldstein 
		reported the delinquency list has been reduced to one page as more and 
		more outstanding financial obligations are being paid to the clubs. She 
		also reminded the club presidents to submit the coaches LOI’s and that 
		to date she has yet to receive any. Wendy reiterated that preliminary 
		rosters are due September 3, 2005 and that AA teams dropping down to the 
		A level must do so before September 15, 2005 in order to be SCAHA post 
		season eligible.</span></p>

		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">No report at this 
		time. Bob did mention that Chris is working diligently to get the Tier 
		Schedule out but needs to have the clubs respond within the timeframe

		cause delays in releasing the schedules.</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Dave Bigelow asked 
		about the Tier weekends. Bob responded that SCAHA will schedule the Tier 
		II for one game around the CAHA weekends and the remaining weekends will 
		be up to the Tier II teams. Sandy clarified she had a meeting with Chris 
		and Bob discussing the rescheduling of games and reiterated that last 
		meeting’s discussion of rescheduling of games was for Tier II teams 
		only. Bob reaffirmed SCAHA’s position that the rescheduling of Tier 
		games requires agreement between the presidents and a rescheduled time 
		and date submitted no later than 30 days from the original scheduled 
		date.</span></p>

		discussion followed when it was determined that there was probably one 
		or two clubs fielding Midget Tier II teams up north. Kevin C. motioned 
		to have SCAHA legal counsel draft a resolution outlining SCAHA’s 
		petition to be exempt from having to play the CAHA mandated Tier 
		weekends. Louis Soltero seconded. <b>MOTION PASSED</b>.</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Bob Doherty discussed SCAHA’s role in trying to 
		promote the sport of hockey among younger players and suggested we 
		should come up with some sort of a marketing strategy. Bob stated that 
		it is time for SCAHA to go further than just talking about it, maybe 
		even launch an advertising campaign with the help of the NHL teams, the 
		Ducks and the Kings. Ron White agreed with Bob and stated that SCAHA 
		needs more exposure. He suggested a possible hockey alliance with the 
		professional teams’ maybe even get some airtime on radio broadcasts.</font></p>

		board that our member clubs that currently have AAA Bantam and AAA 
		Peewee teams would like for SCAHA to facilitate scheduling of exhibition 
		games with SCAHA member clubs. Basically, a PWAAA team would play a BNAA 
		team and a BNAAA team would play a MDAA team. The games would not count 
		and would be on a voluntary basis. The AAA clubs would be responsible 
		for the ice costs. Laura Ryan raised concerns regarding how this would 
		impact the game schedule. Bob assured the board that Chris would produce 
		the master schedule first and then would input the AAA games.</span></p>

		to be included in the scheduling of exhibition games.&nbsp; Lisa England 
		motioned that the exhibition schedule for games with the AAA teams and 
		SDIA be on a voluntary basis and for an email to be sent by SCAHA to its 
		member clubs asking if they are interested in playing these exhibition 
		teams. Larry B seconded it. 16 voted in favor and three abstained. <b>
