    hoping to get local personality to work on campaign. There was one hearing

    but one, which was wrong. Going to San Diego to review, have asked SCAHA to 
    participate in review. Dave Guzy will not be State Referee in Chief. 
    Nominations have been closed. Two PDR waiver appeals (Blackhawks &amp; Stars)

    <font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Dave Monshaw reported 
    that some divisions have odd number of teams. Due to the odd number of teams 
    this creates odd number of games. One team will need to play an extra game, 
    which would only count for one team. Executive Board previously discussed 
    and decided that a week would be selected, written down and put into an 
    envelope and held by Commissioner and then revealed at the end of the 
    season. This game will not count for the team with the extra game. Only game 
    misconducts issued during game will count. Dave will review possibility of 
    adding game to schedule for all teams in odd division; will need to talk to 
    scheduling consultant to see how it would affect. Clubs with teams in odd 
    divisions would need to come up with extra ice. Issue has come up with girls 
    teams, girls are paying $27.00 registration fee and only getting half of the 
    games. It was suggested that all coaches be polled if they want to play 
    against the girls. Dave reminded everyone that Sportability is the most 
    accurate for schedule information. Discussion followed regarding teams 
    dropping from AA to A. CAHA makes final decision regarding teams dropping.

    <font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Annie reported that 
    misconduct list will be updated on Friday. Missing score sheet list will be 
    sent out next week. Reminder that a two game suspension will be issued for 
    two majors in one game for same player (4.04b) If referee does not assess, 
    Annie will process and contact team manager and/or club directly. Make sure 
    to check with referee regarding game misconducts if unsure. Sandy reported 
    that to date there have been 8 games with 2 officials (7 – North, 1 – 
    South.) Question was asked who signs score sheet if player is serving Match 
    Penalty. It was suggested that it should be written in comments that player 
    is serving penalty. If player is serving misconduct, then player must be in 
    attendance at game and sign score sheet. Reminder that any player serving 
    Match Penalty is not allowed to attend any game function. If a player needs 
    to serve Match and Game, they will sit the 30 days first and then serve the 
    game. </font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<br>

    book. Dave Monshaw stated that Sportability has a spot for contact 
    information for each team. If information is put in, can make communication 
    easier for game reschedules. It was requested that each club send team 
    manager information to Dave and Larry. Larry and Cindi will send request 
    letter to each club. It was stated that each club will need to get 
    permission from the Managers to post the information.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<br>
