DEPUTY COMMISSIONER’S REPORT</font></h1>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<font face="Arial" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Sandy reported that that 
has been a marked increase in Match Penalties. They are currently three up for 
review. One review was conducted tonight and two more pending. LAHOA has stated 
that referees have received further training during their seminars on what to 
look for when a Match is appropriate and when it is not. Based on the types of 
infractions being seen, doubt that anything has changed. Seeing an increase of 
kids who are making the sport unsafe. Coach needs to control bench, if player is 
upset, sit the player. Have also received quite a few complaints regarding 
referees being proactive before games are out of hand. At last SCAHA Executive 
meeting Art Kitano was appointed as Referee in Chief, he was previously CAHA 
Referee in Chief. He will be watching and reviewing referees. Complaints have 
been coming in regarding referees being late, it was suggested that clocks be 
put into referees’ room at that rinks. There has been a definite decrease in two 
man games from first week, except for San Diego. Talks have begun with San Diego 
officials hoping to be able to get an officials contract. </font>

cheering or coaching from box. Only in the box to open and close door. Referee
