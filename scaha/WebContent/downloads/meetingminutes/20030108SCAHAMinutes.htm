  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Tony reported that he saw 
  a lot of familiar faces at Wayne’s funeral.&nbsp; It was a shock for everybody.&nbsp; 
  Tony introduced Lisa England, who will be filling in for Wayne.&nbsp; He stated 
  that Easy Street Arena would be covering the dues for Wayne’s son for this 
  year and until he ages out.&nbsp; Tony commented that some clubs have donated money 
  and there have been a lot of nice tributes around the league.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tony suggested 
  that a donation should be made to the Lavaglio family to help out the family.&nbsp; 
  The donation should be comparable to what has been done in the past, even more 
  for all the time that Wayne has put in.&nbsp; Pam Levin inquired as to the 
  different funds that are currently set-up at this.&nbsp; It was discussed and 
  agreed that the check should be made payable to the Lavaglio Family Fund.&nbsp; 
  Larri Woertler made the motion to donate $3,000 to fund the Wayne Lavaglio 
  family fund.&nbsp; Tim Pickett seconded the motion.&nbsp; Dominic Menton commented that 
  $3,000 is generous, but based on current balance sheet and the fact that Wayne 
  gave a lot for many years, can we afford more.&nbsp; Pam Levin inquired if we could 
  amend the motion to $5,000.&nbsp; Larri Woertler made the motion to amend the 
  donation to $5,000. <b>MOTION WAS SECONDED AND CARRIED. </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

  information, email Dave and Tony.&nbsp; Pam Levin asked if the cost per team is 
  known at this time.&nbsp; Tony replied that it should be similar to last year.&nbsp; 
  Once bids have been received with ice cost should be able to determine cost 
  per team.&nbsp; </span></p>

  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Questions have been raised 
  in regards to scheduling for teams.&nbsp; Tony has asked Dave to send out messages 
  to clubs and teams that were affected.&nbsp; Questions are being asked why are some 
  divisions playing 16 games and some 19.&nbsp; Basically schedule was worked out so 
  that all teams would be played at least once.&nbsp; If less than 17 teams in 
  division, in order to even out he had to put extra match ups.&nbsp; John Devereaux 
  inquired as to why schedule are issued so late in season.&nbsp; Tony reminded that 
  due to changes in team movements, it is impossible to put out a complete 
  schedule at the beginning of the year.&nbsp; It was also stated that it was 
  discussed at the beginning of year to allow for teams to be accommodated for 
  Southwest League, Select Camp, Martin Luther King holiday, etc.&nbsp; Dave has been 
  able to make these accommodations for most teams.&nbsp; If a full schedule is put 
  together at the beginning of the season, and teams disband or move then they 
  will be responsible for paying the ice costs and forfeiture fees.&nbsp; It was 
  further discussed that the Presidents had agreed at the beginning of the 
  season to allow for the teams to participate in Southwest.&nbsp; One of the 
  conditions was that the other adjustments would need to be made for other 
  teams traveling at other times also.&nbsp; Dave did make these adjustments.&nbsp; Larry 
  Wilhite commented that at the meeting for final declarations that some teams 
  still did not have their final declarations.&nbsp; A change in one team affects all 
  teams.&nbsp; Tony stated that some teams were denied changes after final 
  declarations were in.&nbsp; Further discussion followed regarding release of 
  schedule for the year and the affect that this could have on clubs with the 
  changes that can occur, especially with the Tier II teams.&nbsp; </span></p>

  email received in November regarding number of games to be scheduled for 
  Bantam AA.&nbsp; Now only have played 15 games with only one more scheduled.&nbsp; Tony 
  will discuss with Dave to inquire as to what happened.&nbsp; Jerry Wilhite stated 
  that will be difficult to fix in three weeks (2 weeks with CAHA Select Camp.)&nbsp; 
  Score sheets are now due February 1<sup>st</sup> versus President’s Day, which 
  also created a loss of two weekends. </span></p>

  how this would affect if team is scheduled and team is missing 4 or 5 players, 
  will team be penalized if unable to attend.&nbsp; John Devereaux made the motion to 
  schedule Tier II games during CAHA Select weekend.&nbsp; Larry Bruyere seconded the

  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Sandy reported that some 
  teams seasons would be ending shortly.&nbsp; Reminder that last season rule was 
  implemented for family member delinquency.&nbsp; It is suggested that as the season 
  comes to an end families should be notified that are delinquent, so that they 
  can clear them up now.&nbsp; When notifying the families remember to quote 18.04, 
  the complete rule.&nbsp; This will tell them how they will be affected and that the 
  delinquency will affect the whole family.&nbsp; Give them the opportunity to make 
  amends.&nbsp; Let them know how to clear the delinquency list.&nbsp; If you would like a 
  sample letter, let Sandy know.&nbsp; It was asked when the delinquency list would 
  be published; specific deadline has not been established yet.&nbsp; Rule does say 
  that you are to notify them two weeks before placing on list.&nbsp; Deadline for 
  placing on list may be April 1<sup>st</sup>, so you are looking at mid March 
  for drop-dead date for notification.&nbsp; </span></p>

  is going to try and draft something on the letter of intent with regards to 
  the dues issue.&nbsp; When people sign the letter of intent that they could be 
  responsible for the entire season dues, if you elect to leave the team for 
  whatever reason during the season.&nbsp; This should be up to the club if they get 
  released from this financial obligation because they make a commitment to you 
  and then leave for another team and leave your team hanging.&nbsp; If enough leave 
  team could experience some problems.&nbsp; We now know that CAHA wants the 
  movement, if they want to move, but CAHA is going to make them financially 
  responsible before they leave.</span></p>

the It Pays program is being done correctly by majority of Mite teams.&nbsp; 
Unfortunately 40% of the teams are not reporting.&nbsp; Emails have been sent to 
Presidents to contact Mite Managers to verify if being done or if having 
problems.&nbsp; Jim Carroll stated that the Ranger Mites were invited to Ducks game 
and were able to meet some of the players. They received 60 tickets for the 
game.&nbsp; Larry reminded everyone that Mite teams have the opportunity to play at

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Tony reported that a 
question has come up regarding PeeWee A, AA movement.&nbsp; Players moving which CAHA 
allowed.&nbsp; Lisa England inquired that the team that they went to have also picked 
up two other players from the same team, which broke the 25% rule, did the board 
meet to waive this rule.&nbsp; Tony stated that at the August SCAHA meeting the 
Presidents decided that if the Presidents agreed that it would be a moot point 
for the SCAHA Executive Board to say no.&nbsp; Jerry Wilhite stated that the 
Presidents voted that if two Presidents agreed that they didn’t have a team for 
kids to play on or there was a reason that more than 3 kids could go to a team 
and if both Presidents agreed on, then that decision stood and it wouldn’t come 
to the Executive Board or Board to vote on.&nbsp; When this situation came up, both 
Presidents agreed on the movement, it did not go to the Board to deal with.&nbsp; 
Wolves did waive off the rule.&nbsp; Further discussion followed regarding 
clarification of 25% rule.&nbsp; If the vote that happened in August is not what the 
Presidents want, then it needs to be revisited. Tony stated after discussion 
that rule will need to be looked at further.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
