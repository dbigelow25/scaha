representatives from Hockey Giant were present to discuss how they would like to 
assist the league with getting more kids involved. Would like to build on 
existing partnership and relationship with SCAHA and expand on top of discount 
cards. Main objective right now is to help secure and strengthen future of 
Southern California ice hockey. In addition will begin having SCAHA Saturdays 
once a month the store will open early for SCAHA members only. Every purchase 
made would kick back 5% of sale to player’s club. New discount cards for next

REPORT</u></b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Bob reported that 
Carmen Starr passed away Thursday morning. CAHA has created an annual award to 
be given in Carmen’s name. The award will be an annual volunteer award in 
administrative capacity. Carmen has been named the first recipient of the award.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Bob read email 
received from Melissa Fitzgerald (CAHA Youth Council) regarding Tier II 
administration. CAHA will expect that SCAHA to treat AA teams same as A &amp; B with 
regards to monitoring teams, i.e., penalty minutes, LOI’s, player-ups, etc. 
These teams are considered club level teams. CAHA will not support us not having 
a Tier program. Bob did research other leagues across the country and could not 
find any leagues without Tier Program. So the question is who will monitor Tier 
II teams, the board needs to revisit this issue and make a decision. Larry 
Brislin made the motion: Notwithstanding and prior motion to the contrary, SCAHA 
will be responsible for scheduling and all other matters related to Tier II 
teams. We agree SCAHA will govern all other matters relating to Tier II teams. 
Alex Dunaev seconded the motion. Discussion followed. Amendment was requested to 
strike last sentence of motion. Bob Driffel moved that SCAHA will schedule all 
mandated SCAHA games to meet 100% of Southern California teams in SCAHA. Ensure 
tier teams meet Southern California SCAHA requirement. <b>MOTION WAS SECONDED 
AND CARRIED.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<br>
