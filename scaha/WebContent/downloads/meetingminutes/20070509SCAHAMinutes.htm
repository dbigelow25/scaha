		<h2>COMMISSIONER’S REPORT</h2>
		<h2><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">Bob Doherty 
		discussed the definition of club mergers. He stated that when a club 
		merges with another association (club), one association is eliminated, 
		i.e. their CAHA number goes away. The merged club loses its seat on the 
		SCAHA board. It no longer exists as a SCAHA club. To re-activate the 
		“old” SCAHA club would require it to file documentation as a new SCAHA 
		member club seeking admittance into the SCAHA league. An association who 
		has merged with another club can not use both CAHA numbers.</span></h2>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">Bob 
		Doherty instructed the presidents to send by email only the club’s 
		bylaws as well as a list of the club directors for the 2007-2008 season.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">Bob 
		Doherty informed the board that the Huntington Beach Sundevils have been 
		inactive for one year and as per our bylaws article 4.1, rule 4.11, they 
		are no longer a member in good standing with SCAHA.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">Bob 
		Doherty summarized the Youth Council meeting held on May 5, 2007. He 
		informed the board that two members were added to the Youth Council, 
		Michael Donahue from Norcal and Rosemary Voulelikas from SCAHA. Two 
		proposals were reviewed at the YC meeting. The SCAHA Tier II proposal 
		version #2 (qualifying weekend) was supported by the Youth Council with 
		the exception of a few changes to the wording to reflect that a CAHA 
		mandated schedule would depend on the bids submitted, i.e. pending ice 
		availability. Youth Council will be recommending to the full CAHA board 
		to approve the Tier II proposal.&nbsp; The second proposal discussed at the 
		Youth Council meeting was a Tier I proposal submitted by the Tier Task 
		Force formed by the CAHA Youth Council Chair. The proposal involved 
		implementing new rules including PDR for the Tier I level. The Youth 
		Council unanimously did not support the proposal.</span></p>

		Doherty informed the board that he has sent James Parker an email 
		regarding the LAHOA contract. Bob Doherty stated that he has sent them 
		numerous emails requesting a contract.</span></p>

		<h2>DEPUTY COMMISSIONER’S REPORT</h2>

		Committee for the 2007-2008 season would be meeting next Saturday and

		Goldstein distributed the LOI packets to the club presidents. In 
		addition she informed the board that she would be emailing the updated 
		delinquency list the morning of June 1, 2007. She reminded the board 
		should anyone club allow a player who is on the league wide delinquency 
		list to skate at their tryouts, that club will not be able to have that 
		player participate in their program for the 2007-2008 season.</span></p>

		addition, Wendy Blumberg stated that the total outstanding of the aged 
		out Midgets is $23,000. The WHL will be working with SCAHA with regards

		players may get through the tryout process but will not be able to sign 
		with a junior team in the Western Hockey League unless their SCAHA 
		financial obligation has been met.</span></p>

		<h2><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">Wendy 
		Goldstein highlighted some of the key points for clubs to remember 
		during tryouts and awarding of LOI’s to players. She advised the board 
		that they should make sure that the pink copy is given to the parents 
		and that a club representative is the one that writes in the club name 
		on the LOI. In addition, clubs should be submitting their LOI’s on a 
		weekly basis.</span></h2>

		for hat tricks, play maker and shut outs from USA Hockey. In addition, 
		Annie Fisher is still missing the mailing addresses for players who will 
		be receiving patches from the Eagles, Mariners, Stars and the Express. 
		The statistics for the 2006-2007 season have been locked in 
		sportability. Bob Doherty explained that there are people trying to hack 
		into our system. This year the stats will be available in pdf format 
		only and will not be available online as in the past.</span></p>
