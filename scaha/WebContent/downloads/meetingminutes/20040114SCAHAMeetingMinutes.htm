<font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Tony introduced James 
Gasseau of LA Hockey. James was present to petition to allow LA Hockey to join 
the league. Discussion followed along with questions and answers. Vote was taken 
to allow LA Hockey into league. Yes – 18, No – 4. Vote did pass and LA Hockey 
will be a part of the league beginning with the 2004/2005 season on probation 
status.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Tony reported 
that $10,000 was distributed in scholarships. There were 50 players that 
received $200. each. Would like to request an additional amount of $1,400 so 
that 7 more players may receive scholarships. The monies were spread out over 
the league, no one club received more than $1,000. Not all clubs applied for 
scholarships. Larri Woertler moved to approve an additional $1,400 for 
scholarships. <b>MOTION WAS SECONDED AND CARRIED.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<br>

<font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Sandy reported that at 
this time have not been able to get a contract with the San Diego Referee 
Association. It was agreed during discussions with the association that the 1<sup>st</sup> 
priority is safety and 2<sup>nd</sup> priority is assuring coverage for games. 
Have another meeting scheduled for January 29<sup>th</sup>. Most likely will 
still not be able to get a contract but hope to put together a memorandum of 
understanding. LAHOA will be assisting with ensuring coverage for games.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<br>

Calder from Long Beach Ice Dogs. Debbie reported that the Long Beach Ice Dogs 
would like to again have the SCAHA Championship games held at the Long Beach Ice 
Arena same as last year. In addition Debbie distributed flyers regarding Amateur 
Night at the Long Beach Ice Arena. Tony reminded everyone that bids for playoffs 
are due February 1<sup>st</sup>. It was asked what the cost variance was to have 
the Championship games held at the Long Beach Ice Arena versus local ice rinks. 
Tony replied that it cost less to have the games at the Long Beach Ice Arena.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<br>

<font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Raoul Smyth presented 
his proposal regarding expanding the playoff slots in the larger divisions. He 
recommended that in the divisions with 15 plus teams to expand the playoff slots 
from 8 to 10. The top 2 finishers would have a bye to the final round. It was 
also suggested that the league should recognize each team who finishes the 
regular season in 1<sup>st</sup> place with some type of award. It was 
recommended that banners could be awarded to these teams. Raoul recommended two 
motions: Motion #1: For this season expand playoffs slots for the affected 
divisions. Top 2 teams would receive a bye. Motion #2: Recognize regular season 
1<sup>st</sup> place teams with banners. Both motions were seconded, but neither 
motion passed.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<br>

<font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Tony reported that the 
Executive Board would like to begin the transition to the new board over the 
next couple months. Nominations are being accepted for both Commissioner and 
Deputy Commissioner. New board should be in place prior to tryouts. Elections 
will be conducted at the March meeting. Nominations are due by 2/28/04 to Shari

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Sandy reported that 
there has been an increase this year in game misconducts. This year game 
misconducts are being doubled. If a player receives two majors in a game he 
receives two game misconducts. One incident in a game can create multiple 
misconducts. In prior years if a player received three game misconducts they 
were suspended for thirty days. Last month request was made of the Executive 
Board for discretion for the review committee to evaluate and to be given 
discretion to determine if hearing is needed. In addition Sandy reported that 
the review committee is well aware of the Huntington Beach situation and the 
review committee is taking steps to make sure that the incident is dealt with. 
At no time are parents allowed to go onto the ice. CAHA rule this year, any 
player leaving the bench during any altercation will receive a 30 day penalty; 
the rule does not specify joining the altercation, just leaving the bench. Would 
like to implement that at the end of the game would like to have the referee 
split the kids however they see necessary. Not to go onto the ice until the 
referee indicates. Will use Executive Board recommendation.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<br>

TREASURER’S REPORT</u></b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Curt distributed for 
review the current financial reports. Current balance sheet reflects $223,405.33 
in three accounts as of today. Profit and Loss is okay in every category. 
Accounting is 28% over budget. Income is down due to lower interest rates in 
addition to fine and penalties less this year. Playoff budget based on last 
years numbers. Deposit detail was also reviewed. Checks from SCAHA precamp have 
been deposited. Remind members that any checks that do not clear will be put on 
delinquency list. SCAHA precamp netted $700. after expenses. 136 players are 
advancing to the CAHA camp. Raoul Smyth moved to ratify the amount. <b>MOTION 
WAS SECONDED AND CARRIED.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Curt distributed 
for review the distribution model due to the excess of funds. The allocation was 
based on teams; suggest making final decision until after all fees have been 
finalized. It was suggested that registration fees be waived. Larri Woertler 
noted that need to know how many midgets will be aging out this year. It was 
stated that we need to have a cost effective entry level. Raoul Smyth 
recommended that the proposal be tabled and everyone review prior to next months 
meeting. It was also stated that before any financial decisions or commitments 
are made that it needs to be brought before the full board. Any ideas or 
suggestions for the committee regarding the excess funds should be emailed to 
Jerry Wilhite. </font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<br>

<font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em"><b><u>ICE CONVENOR 
REPORT</u></b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Tony reported that 
having a committee working on the schedule together was not working. Would like 
to recommend that Chris Carcerano be hired as the Ice Convernor. Dave Bigelow 
moved to have SCAHA appoint Chris Carcerano as Ice Convenor. <b>MOTION WAS 
SECONDED AND CARRIED.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Chris presented 
a brief status on the second half of the schedule. There were certain parameters 
given to Bortz Media to prepare the schedule. 1. Preserve Home &amp; Away Balance; 
2. Round Robin format, play all teams; 3. Black out dates; 4. Each team play all 
teams at least once. Travel distance between games was not considered. The home 
and away balance was achieved, not at the team level but at the division level. 
Rec. schedule is in good shape, both home &amp; away and round robin was achieved. 
Tier, home &amp; away was achieved; round robin was not achieved due to issues with 
available ice. 100% CAHA rule will be achieved with Midget 17 AA. Number one 
complaint received is not enough time between double header games. Teams can 
reschedule these games, if both clubs agree reschedule and let Chris know. Tier 
round robin was not achieved – bad ice slots, team match-ups difficult at this 
point, impacts the entire division. Black out weekends is big issue. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Possible solution to 
think about for next season, change ice slot requirement formula, needs an 
increase. Teams requesting byes need to provide additional ice. Suggest schedule 
more double headers earlier in the season. Would like to form a committee to 
brainstorm suggestions to recommend to Executive Board and Full Board. Chris 
will chair the committee.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Discussion 
followed regarding scheduling issues. It was discussed that in the Midget 17AA 
division one of the teams ended up scheduling 40% of their games and don’t feel 
they should pay the entire registration fee that it should be prorated. No 
motion was made in regards to prorating the fees. Discussion also followed 
regarding Bantam A teams (clubs with two teams) did not play each other in the 
first round. How would this be handled? It was stated at this point in the 
season nothing can be changed with this portion of the schedule. There is not 
enough ice available to schedule the game earlier. For the teams with odd number 
of teams, the week number was pulled to see which game would be eliminated. If 
the number drawn is a bye week, then it will fall on the following week. Jerry &amp; 
Sandy will hold the week number until the end of the season.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<br>
