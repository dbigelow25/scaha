		<h2>COMMISSIONER’S REPORT</h2>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Sandy Blumberg asked 
		the board to execute the SDRH contract by email. The contract will 
		mirror the LAHOA contract and should be ready in a couple of weeks. The 
		contract will be emailed to all the club presidents. Laura Ryan motioned 
		to execute the SDRH contract by email and Lisa England seconded. <b>
		MOTION PASSED</b>.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Sandy Blumberg 
		informed the board that the number of penalty minutes in games is 
		starting to improve compared to the first weekend of play. The referees 
		are still being trained with regards to the “New Standards of Play,” and 
		consistency amongst the calls would waiver for a few more weeks.</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Coaches receiving 
		game suspensions must serve the suspension with the team they received 
		the game suspension. The coaches are still permitted to coach their 
		teams.&nbsp; Sandy Blumberg stated the practice of head coaches signing in as 
		assistant coaches in order to avoid having to serve the game misconduct 
		penalty assigned to the head coach of a team receiving 15 penalties in a 
		game will not be accepted practice by the league. It is unethical and 
		the league will hold hearings. </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Sandy Blumberg also 
		stated SCAHA has had some problems with coaches refusing to wear 
		helmets. The CAHA president, Charlie Fuertsch, has USA Hockey’s support 
		to pull a coach’s coaching card should he continue to violate USA 
		Hockey’s helmet rule.</span></p>

		and is in need of volunteers for both locations. Tim Fahringer and LeAnn 
		Doherty will be running the locations. The Select camp will need people 
		to assist in the administration and planning of the camp as well as on 
		ice coaches and off ice evaluators. Bids will go out to the various 
		clubs and rinks to host the select camp. And finally, a volunteer form

		<h1><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">MEMBER SERVICES REPORT</span></h1>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">Wendy Goldstein expressed concern over the number
