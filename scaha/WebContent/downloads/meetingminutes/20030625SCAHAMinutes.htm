<font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Sandy reported that at 
the annual CAHA meeting, Lisa England was voted in as a new CAHA Director. There 
are currently three vacancies on their Board of Directors; decision of whether 
to fill those positions will be made within the next 30 days. There was some 
discussion on the upcoming coaching clinic for advanced certification. Charlie 
Feurtsch was elected as the new CAHA President and Tony was nominated for 1<sup>st</sup> 
Vice President. They did not fill any of the positions, 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 
3<sup>rd </sup>Vice President, Treasurer, Secretary, etc. Those positions will 
be filled by the Board of Directors by email within the next 30 days. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Tony reported that a 
special hearing was held before the CAHA meeting involving the two people SCAHA 
had previously suspended. Each side had an opportunity to present their case. A 
decision was made by CAHA to suspend both for 5 years from all CAHA activities. 
SCAHA had previously suspended both for 2 years. The 5-year suspension will 
override our 2-year suspension.</font><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Tony distributed 
for review the current rules changes. USA Hockey has made change regarding use 
of pucks for Mites &amp; Squirts; all Mites &amp; Squirts must now use the blue pucks 
for both practices and games. Suggestion was made that SCAHA purchase the blue 
pucks for all Mite &amp; Squirt teams, discussion followed. Rick Kent moved to have 
SCAHA purchase 25 pucks for each Mite &amp; Squirt team. <b>MOTION WAS SECONDED AND 
CARRIED.</b></font></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Curt distributed for 
review the current financial statement for end of current fiscal year. Review 
was conducted of Balance Sheet, Profit &amp; Loss Statement, Profit &amp; Loss Budget 
versus Actual, Deposit &amp; Check Detail and Proposed Budget for 2003/2004. Also 
distributed for review was summary from Charles Fedak of the results of the 
reconciliation, which was performed and how it was reported on the Amended 
Returns for SCAHA. Tax returns have been filed, the only outstanding issue with 
the tax returns at this time is the filing of 1099’s. Both Reynolds Cafferata 
and Charles Fedak will address the 1099 issue tonight before the Board. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Curt reported that the 
Executive Board interviewed three attorneys to assist with the IRS filings. Curt 
introduced Reynolds Cafferata of Riordan &amp; McKenzie who was selected to 
represent us. </font><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Mr. Cafferata 
reviewed the current legal status of the tax situation. One issue still 
unresolved is payments that were made to coaches. Some of those payments were in 
excess of $600 and if you make a payment to someone in excess of $600 for 
services, you are required to file 1099’s. If these payments were for 
reimbursement for expenses and not services, then no 1099's are required. It was 
also suggested that we should consider requesting from previous Tier I Director 
and Commissioner reimbursement for legal and accounting fees. These expenses 
would not have been incurred by the organization if they had not conducted 
activities in the manner that they did. It is money out of the organizations 
pocket. Question and answers followed including discussion regarding 1099’s. Tim 
Rodda moved to 1099 all coaches for full amount shown in books and let them have 
burden of showing expenses. <b>MOTION WAS SECONDED AND CARRIED.</b></font><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;<br>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Charles Fedak was 
introduced and was available for discussion and questions. It was recommended 
that we might want to request reimbursement from the individuals involved for 
legal and accounting fees, which have been incurred. To dates we have paid 
$23,000 in accounting fees and $5,000 in legal fees. In addition we will have 
$50 penalty for each 1099 per year, which needs to be filed. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Raoul Smyth moved to 
defer decision about whether we pursue this until process is complete and have a 
better understanding of IRS implications, fines, etc. Tim Rodda seconded. 
Discussion followed regarding motion. Raoul Smyth made an amendment to motion, 
we ask each potentially responsible party for reimbursement of expenses to date 
and defer decision for legal action to collect until we know full amount. <b>

COORDINATOR</u></b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Larry reported that it is 
still sketchy regarding proper requirements for coaches certification 
requirements this year. Ron White is currently trying to get the correct 
information. He hopes to have the final answer at the August 20<sup>th</sup> 
Pacific District Advanced Coaches Clinic in Reno. Sandy reported that at the 
CAHA meeting because of the Advanced Coaching Clinic that is coming up there was 
some concern people may not realize that they need to take it. They recommended 
that all bench personnel at the Midget Tier I &amp; Tier II would be required (they 
believe) to have an Advanced Coaching Certification. That includes trainers or 
anyone else on the bench; they will no longer be allowed to be there unless they 
have the advanced certification. The recommendation was that you make sure all 
bench personnel Midget Tier I &amp; Tier II have the advanced certification. They 
also believe that it will be moving from Reno next year to Alaska. It may also 
become necessary for Head Coaches at the Bantam &amp; PeeWee Tier Level. Further 
discussion followed regarding proper certifications for Tier levels. Larry 
stated that he will check into next few days and will let everyone know. He 
recommended that coaches go forward and receive the certification, most likely 
will need next year.</font><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;<br>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Sandy thanked everyone 
who worked on the Rules Committee. Changes were distributed for review and 
discussion. Question was raised regarding 22.01; it was asked if there is an 
issue how quickly clubs respond to requests for release. Tony responded that at 
the last meeting it was discussed that we need to set-up guidelines for 
responding to requests. It was recommended that if a club doesn’t respond within 
7 days to request for release, then the parent could submit request to board 
after 7 days. It was stated that the clubs need to acknowledge by the 7<sup>th</sup> 
day and respond with decision within 14 days. The Executive Committee will also 
respond to appeals by the 7<sup>th</sup> day with final determination within 14 
days in regards to the 25% rule. Review and discussion followed regarding 
updates and changes to rules. </font><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;<br>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">It was recommended that 
we add to 17.05 that all members who sign letters of intent clearly understand 
that signing that letter of intent is gaining access to the league as a member 
through their organization that they are signing with. Not only are they abiding 
by the SCAHA rules but also they are acknowledging by the letter of intent that 
it is in addition to any bylaws or rules that they might have to commit to with 
their own organization. </font><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;<br>

the USA Hockey &amp; CAHA rules changes this year, it is important to make sure that

the parent has the back pink copy because that is where the SCAHA Conditions of 
Membership are printed. </font><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;<br>

this point, we are going to ask for information to have on file for each club as

preseason games to assist with declaring teams. It was recommended that some 
games be added during week and also need additional Saturday ice to assist with 
the scheduling. Incorporated into the schedule will also be weekends to assist 
with Tier scheduling for Norcal &amp; SCAHA to cover the 100%. Tier teams will need
