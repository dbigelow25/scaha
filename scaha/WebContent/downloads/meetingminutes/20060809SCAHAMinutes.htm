		<h2>GUEST</h2>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Bob Doherty 
		introduced Ken Bamberg and Matt Payne from the Anaheim Ducks. Ken 
		Bamberg explained the various club-team fundraising opportunities with 
		the Anaheim Ducks. He explained about using ticket sales at half the 
		cost of the face value, intermission skates, jumbotron posting as well 
		as silent auction tables. He also stated that the Anaheim Ducks were 
		able to assist clubs with internal fundraising that does not involve the 
		Anaheim Ducks such as casino nights, skate-a-thons, etc. Do not hesitate 
		to contact them and let them know about your fundraiser in particular 
		what, where, how and when, and they may be able to assist you with a 
		signed item that you may be able to raffle off. Ken Bamberg distributed 
		packets with information regarding Anaheim Ducks’ schedule. And finally, 
		Ken Bamberg stated that they are fortunate to be involved with the 
		Champs program.</span></p>

		<h2>COMMISSIONER’S REPORT</h2>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Bob Doherty 
		distributed the final version of the LAHOA contract and informed the 
		board that James Parker, president of LAHOA, signed off on the LAHOA 
		contract. Bob Doherty stated that once executed by SCAHA he would send a 
		copy by email to all the presidents in pdf format. Bob Doherty stated 
		that the next step is to go into negotiations with the San Diego referee 
		association. He basically stated that as far as he was concerned he 
		would be negotiating for last year’s rates.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Bob Doherty 
		distributed the CAHA bid packages for State Tournaments. He encouraged 
		clubs to submit bids even those rinks that have only one rink surface. 
		He suggested they should collaborate and combine with other rinks and 
		submit a joint bid. He added that he was not sure if CAHA’s Youth 
		Council would consider such a bid but stated that it was worth a try.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Bob Doherty spoke 
		about formation of teams that do not meet CAHA’s PDR. He cited SCAHA’s 
		bylaw 4.03, which states that “<i>all teams of the member club must be 
		members of SCAHA.”</i> Bob Doherty added that SCAHA could not exclude 
		teams that do not meet PDR from the SCAHA schedule because of this 
		bylaw. It does not address whether a team is post season eligible or not 
		in order for it to be part of the SCAHA schedule. Although CAHA has 
		decided that teams not meeting PDR will not be scheduled in the CAHA 
		mandated Tier II weekends, SCAHA will abide by its bylaw 4.03 and 
		schedule all member teams in its SCAHA schedule. Bob Doherty reiterated 
		that waivers will not be granted especially for the PDR rule and that 
		clubs must notify all the parents in writing of those teams that they 
		are not playoff eligible. </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Robert Doherty 
		informed the board that the only club teams that would not be scheduled 
		in the SCAHA schedule will be those clubs that were fined last season 
		and have yet to pay. They will be issued a final registered letter and 
		if at that time they still do not pay they, the entire club teams will 
		not play in the preseason schedule. Bob Doherty informed the board that 
		currently five clubs still owe payment for fines. He also reminded the 
		board that according to our bylaws they have 30 days to respond to a 
		fine. These same clubs were first notified six months ago and have been 
		reminded numerous times through re-issuance of letters.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Bob Doherty reported 
		on the preliminary team declarations stating that 15 Mite B teams, 5 
		Mite A teams, 15 Squirt B teams and 19 Squirt A teams were declared by 
		clubs. He continued to state that this represents a growth of 35% if not 
		more of youth hockey in Southern California and commended the clubs on 
		doing a great job.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Robert Doherty 
		reminded the board that all coaches, managers and volunteers who come 
		into regular contact with minors must be screened as per the CAHA 
		mandated screening policy. He added that he would resend the email from 
		Carla Dickerson, who is the CAHA screening administrator to all 
		presidents.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">

		<h2>DEPUTY COMMISSIONER’S REPORT</h2>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Sandy Blumberg 
		informed the board that the first referee seminar was held in 
		Bakersfield. Art Kitano attended the seminar on behalf of the league. 
		The biggest concern expressed by the officials was implementing USA 
		Hockey’ s emphasis on new standards of play consistently and fairly 
		across the board. The league shares the same concern as well as game 
		curfews as penalties start to add up. Art Kitano has in his possession a 
		video supplied by USA Hockey that demonstrates the new calls. He is 
		willing to make himself available as well as James Parker to organize 
		viewing the video with clubs and their coaches to help promote a better 
		understanding of the type of calls they may expect and to answer 
		questions and concerns the coaches might have.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Sandy Blumberg 
		informed the board that SCAHA is going to continue with the online game 
		summary reporting and will add to the evaluation of referees’ form a 
		section for commenting on the enforcement of the new standard of play.
		</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Sandy Blumberg 
		reported that our web site is being updated and will be featuring our 
		own on-ice officials only reporting. In the past the officials would 
		report on the LAHOA web site. Now they will be reporting on our web site 
		and this will facilitate the delivery of reports to SCAHA.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Sandy Blumberg asked 
		for volunteers to sit on this season’s disciplinary committee. Those 
		interested should email Sandy Blumberg. </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<h1><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">MEMBER SERVICES REPORT</span></h1>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">Wendy Goldstein asked the presidents to remind 
		their registrars to mail in the LOI’s once a week. She reiterated that 
		the registrars’ training is on August 19, 2006 at Skate Zone starting at 
		8 am until 11 am. Wendy Goldstein reported that just over 50% of the 
		delinquencies have been cleared.</p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Bob Doherty asked 
		the board to send Chris Carcerano notification of any teams dropping at 
		this time. In addition, if clubs have teams with player openings they 
		should also send that information for him to post on the SCAHA web site. 
		This is a service SCAHA provides its member clubs.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Wendy Goldstein 
		added to inform her of LOI’s that are being voided because of teams 
		dropping or disbanding as well as any player movement within the club 
		because of teams dropping or disbanding.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">Once the calendar is finalized, Chris Carcerano 
		will sent it out by email. There will be four (4) preseason games and 
		possibly 16-17 season games.</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
		<h2>STATISTICIAN REPORT</h2>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">Annie Fisher distributed a flyer outlining 
		SCAHA’s first annual workshop for all managers to attend. The workshop’s 
		goal is to train the team managers with regards to rules, score sheet 
		procedures, etc. They are asking for $5 to assist with the purchasing of 
		materials. Annie Fisher stated that she has spots for 160 managers per 
		location and welcomes all managers and co-managers to attend. This is 
		for all A/B and Tier II teams. Annie Fisher added that the team packets 
		would be distributed at this meeting.</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">Sandy Blumberg stated that this expense of 
		renting two locations, providing food, etc. is not in the SCAHA budget. 
		She suggested that we use the reserve to offset the cost of this 
		worthwhile training program. Laura Ryan motioned to approve a cost of up 
		to $8,000 for the SCAHA workshop. Bridget Hopkinson seconded. <b>MOTION 
		PASSED.</b></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><u>TREASURER’S REPORT</u></b></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">Bob Driffill distributed the financials dated 
		June 30, 2006 to the board and suggested for housekeeping reasons that 
		we close the First Republic Bank’s money market account and deposit all 
		the funds into the City National Securities account. This will allow 
		SCAHA to have all its assets in one entity and it will still require 
		board resolutions to withdraw any of it. Bob Doherty stated that an 
		individual a long time ago started this account and it is in the 
		league’s best interest to consolidate its accounts. Kevin Culbertson 
		motioned to authorize the secretary to draft a formal letter authorizing 
		the treasurer to close the First Republic Bank’s account and to deposit 
		the funds into the City National Securities account. Laura Ryan 
		seconded. <b>MOTION PASSED</b>.</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">Included in the financials is the 2006-2007 
		budget draft. Bob Driffill pointed out that the scholarship fund results 
		from contributions, fines and interest accumulated. Ron White motioned 
		to accept the budget and James Mondragon seconded. <b>MOTION PASSED.</b></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">Laurie Boaz reported to the board that the 
		scholarship applications will be available on the web site August 21, 
		2006 and will be due to SCAHA October 1, 2006 along with the necessary 
		documentation required. Laurie Boaz stressed that applicants should 
		avoid sending their applications by certified mail and must waive all 
		signature requirements. Scholarship awardees will be notified by 
		November 19, 2006. Clubs will be issued the checks on behalf of the 
		awardees. Those not receiving scholarships will not be notified.</p>

		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">ACE COACHING 
		COORDINATOR REPORT</span></u></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Larry Bruyere 
		reminded the presidents that the coaches’ certification clinics are 
		coming up. Levels 1, 2 and 3 will be held at Valencia, September 16 and 
		at Lakewood on September 23, 2006. He added that coaches are not able to 
		complete all three levels in one weekend. They must attend two separate 
		weekends in order to complete all three levels. Level 4 coaches’ clinic 
		is being held in Reno, August 24-26<sup>th</sup>. You can register 
		online for all clinics and for the Level 4 clinic they will not be 
		accepting any registrations after August 15, 2006.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The helmet rule is 
		effective now because teams are formed and are practicing now. Larry 
		Bruyere’s concern is what is the league’s stance in terms of penalizing 
		coaches that are not wearing it. Larry Bruyere would like to determine 
		what the sanctions are in enforcing the rule and ensuring compliance 
		amongst the coaches. Bob Doherty stated that ultimately the club 
		presidents and the rink owners are responsible to enforce this rule. Ron 
		White stated that should a coach not abide by this rule it will void USA 
		Hockey’s liability insurance.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Larry Bruyere 
		motioned to have the club presidents and/or their representatives 
		sanction any coach who does not comply with the USA Hockey helmet rule 
		(all infractions must first be documented) in the following manner:</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">1- First offence a 
		written warning will be issued and said coach will be removed from the 
		ice immediately and must comply with the helmet rule in order to return 
		to the ice.</span></p>

		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2-

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">3- Third offence a 
		match penalty will be issued and must appear before the SCAHA 
		Disciplinary Committee.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">All offences should

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The question was 
		raised regarding the wearing of a helmet during stick time, clinics and 
		private lessons. Ron White stated that at any USA Hockey sanctioned 
		event, the coaches must abide by the USA Hockey helmet rule. </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Ron White wanted to 
		clarify the screening requirement for student coaches and stated that by 
		law a student coach does not have to be screened. The reasoning being is 
		that the student coach is a minor.</span></p>

		<h4>NEW BUSINESS</h4>
		<p class="MsoBodyText2">No new business to report.</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText2">&nbsp;</p>
		<h4>OLD BUSINESS</h4>
		<h4>Recruiting and the Recruiting Rule</h4>
		<p class="MsoBodyText2">Kevin Culbertson shared some of his concerns 
		regarding recruiting. In particular, he feels that many clubs falsely 
		declare Tier teams. He also stated that recruitment season actually 
		starts in the spring for AAA summer teams. Kevin Culbertson asked why do 
		we have recruitment rules when recruitment is going on and we have no 
		way to stop it. Bob Doherty stated that SCAHA has had hearings regarding 
		recruitment violations in the last two years and has sanctioned those 
		involved.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">LeAnn Doherty asked 
		the club presidents to email their managers the C.H.A.M.P.S. packet. On 
		the back of the hard copy LeAnn Doherty prepared a guideline outlining 
		the steps. If anyone has any questions to please call LeAnn Doherty. She 
		stated that she would like to have a representative from each club 
		participating. Please have these club representatives- coordinators 
		email LeAnn Doherty if they have any questions and/or concerns. They 
		will be using last year’s report card and using the full year so as to 
		get the patches on their uniforms as soon as possible. Both the Kings 
		and the Ducks are working on their designs and it looks like we could 
		have them by November of this year. We are also accepting the grades of 
		home schooled players. The tickets that would be given to the players 
		will most probably be for a January game.</span></p>
