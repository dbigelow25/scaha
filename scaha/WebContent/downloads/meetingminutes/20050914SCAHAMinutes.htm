		<b><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">SCAHA Pre 
		Select Camp:</span></u></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Bob Doherty informed 
		the board that LeAnn Doherty has volunteered to head up the SCAHA Pre 
		Select Camp Committee. SCAHA is looking for volunteers and evaluators to 
		assist, plan and execute. All those interested in helping out are 
		encouraged to email Bob Doherty. It is SCAHA’s intention to prepare and 
		send out bid packets for the Select Camp to clubs and rinks. The SCAHA 
		Select Camp is to be held December 17-18, 2005.</span></p>

		<b><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Promotion of 
		Youth Hockey: </span></u></b></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">Bob Doherty reiterated a necessity for SCAHA to 
		look into acquiring free advertising of SCAHA within its own member club 
		rinks.</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><u>Protective Equipment:</u></b></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">Bob stated that he has witnessed flagrant abuse 
		of USA Hockey’s rule regarding &nbsp;&nbsp; protective equipment- torn hockey 
		pants on numerous Midget players. He advised the presidents he is 
		putting them on notice regarding this issue as well as torn hockey 
		gloves. He will instruct the officials to assess a two minute misconduct 
		penalty as per USA Hockey rule 4.03 Section E. He also advised the 
		presidents that the rule allows for the removal of the offending player.</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><u>LAHOA Contract:</u></b></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">A copy of the executed and signed LAHOA contract 
		was distributed to all the presidents. Discussions were tabled until the 
		end of the meeting to give the presidents a chance to review the 
		document.</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">Bob informed the presidents of the negotiations 
		between SCAHA and the San Diego’s officials association. The contract is 
		almost a duplicate copy of LAHOA’s except for a few sections. SCAHA 
		requested that there be a section for reporting purposes and LAHOA has 
		offered San Diego their web site to facilitate this feature. The 
		contract stipulates that 85% of the games would use a three man system 
		with similar pay rates as LAHOA’s contract.</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">Bob reported he was informed by CAHA that USA 
		Hockey requires that the handshake occur at the end of the game and not 
		at the beginning of the game. He reminded the presidents that it was 
		James Parker’s recommendation and their vote at a previous meeting that 
		changed this.&nbsp; Therefore, the handshake will occur as per USA Hockey’s 
		rule and CAHA’s directive at the beginning of the game.</p>

		<h2>DEPUTY COMMISSIONER’S REPORT</h2>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Sandy informed the 
		board that the online SCAHA forms are very easy to use and user 
		friendly. All game reports are automatically sent to three people, SCAHA 
		Deputy Commissioner, SCAHA Statistician and the LAHOA president. She 
		advised the presidents to remind their managers of the 24-hour reporting 
		requirement. Annie Fisher, SCAHA statistician has reported she is 
		missing a considerable amount of game information. </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Sandy reported SCAHA 
		already has five (5) Match penalties to review and the season has just 
		started. The Match penalties are evenly split between players and 
		coaches. Sandy stated the Penalty Review Committee this season will meet 
		not more than twice a month regardless of the volume. And finally, Sandy 
		reminded the presidents that if a penalty assessed under USA Hockey’s 
		rule 601( j ) is upheld, it can carry up to a one year suspension.</span></p>

		<b><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">TREASURER’S 
		REPORT</span></u></b></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">Bob Driffill distributed a copy of SCAHA’s 
		financial statement as of July 31, 2005. He reported that the Executive 
		Committee has not had a chance to review the trial budget and will 
		present the budget at the next SCAHA meeting for review and approval 
		from the presidents. He also handed out a chart indicating the SCAHA 
		player fees owed by the member clubs.</p>

		<h1><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">MEMBER SERVICES REPORT</span></h1>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Wendy Goldstein 
		reiterated if players and/or coaches are not on your roster then they 
		are not allowed on your bench. Coaches who failed to update their 
		certification last season will not be permitted to be rostered on any 
		team as a coach or assistant coach until they have completed their 
		recertification and/or upgrade as required. </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Curt Castagna stated 
		that a non registered or non rostered player and/or coach on a teams ice 
		voids USA Hockey’s insurance for all players and coaches. Curt cited an 
		example from last season when a parent volunteer was injured during a 
		practice. Although the volunteer was USA registered, USA Hockey denied 
		his claim based on the fact that he was not rostered on the team. Wendy 
		stated and Rosemary confirmed that at all the registrar’s training 
		meetings, USA Hockey has always reiterated, “not on your roster not on 
		your ice”. Larry Bruyere stated he would ask John Bjeldanes, USA Hockey 
		Pacific District Risk manager to clarify this issue hopefully in 
		writing.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Wendy also stated 
		that coaches that are new to SCAHA this season have until December 31, 
		2005 to acquire their appropriate certification. Clubs are required to 
		submit copies of the coaches’ cards as they are certified and/or 
		recertified. Wendy distributed stop patches to those member clubs that 
		had new players to SCAHA and reminded everyone that SCAHA player 
		registration fees were due. Wendy mentioned all player movement 
		including reverted players requires a release and gave a brief overview 
		of the process as outlined in the 2005-2006 SCAHA rules. All releases 
		first go to Wendy for final approval and then SCAHA will forward the 
		signed off release to all parties. Once the receiving club has received 
		the approved SCAHA signed release then the club may add the player to 
		their roster and not before.</span></p>

		REPORT</span></u></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Chris stated that as 
		a result of one club not providing its ice slots, the schedule was 
		released later than first anticipated. In order to avoid repeating this 
		SCAHA will issue cut off dates for ice and final team declarations as 
		well as possibly fining clubs for late submittal. The final date for 
		teams dropping from AA to A and still be post season eligible is 
		September 15 and the final A/B team declarations will be due to SCAHA 
		September 25. The presidents were also reminded that if teams had less 
		than 13 rostered players as per SCAHA’s minimum requirement then they 
		should not be declaring team status. Chris informed the board that games 
		will not be scheduled for those age groups that are eligible to 
		participate in the SCAHA Pre-Select Camp. The Select camp weekend is 
		scheduled for December 17 to 18, 2005.</span></p>
