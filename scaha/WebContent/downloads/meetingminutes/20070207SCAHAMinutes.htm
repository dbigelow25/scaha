		be reviewing their list of candidates for election of CAHA directors to 
		the CAHA board. The candidates they are supporting should be candidates 
		that will attend the CAHA board meetings. There were times this past 
		year where issues were presented and because there were missing 
		directors, SCAHA did not have a strong voice.</span></p>

		<h2>DEPUTY COMMISSIONER’S REPORT</h2>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Sandy Blumberg 
		reported that penalty review is going well. Sandy Blumberg stated that 
		when we first instituted the SCAHA spectator ejection rule, we probably 
		caught the majority of parental offenders in the first two years. This 
		year we are seeing a different trend where referees are ejecting 
		spectators possibly a little too prematurely.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Sandy Blumberg 
		informed the board that she has had conversations with James Parker of 
		LAHOA informing him that he needs to speak with the officials and advise 
		them that if this trend continues SCAHA will be overturning many of the 
		ejections. The player ejections is actually down at this time this year.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Sandy Blumberg 
		informed the board that at the end of the CAHA meeting, Pacific District 
		director Dick Coombs reported on a lawsuit that is currently going on in 
		Alaska involving an official who tried to collect unemployment insurance 
		when he lost his regular job. The IRS stated that the AHOA who paid this 
		official should have been deducting taxes etc. USA Hockey is following 
		this very closely as the final outcome of this lawsuit may have a huge 
		impact on how things are done. Dick Coombs made three recommendations.

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In Sandy Blumberg’s 
		preliminary conversations, the consensus arrived at is that all the 
		responsibilities should be shifted to the local official association. 
		This might be the impetus that leads us to having centralized 
		scheduling. It would be a lot easier for billing purposes, etc.</span></p>

		informed the board that 9 additional games would be added to the

		of the girls’ exhibition games. The home team for these additional games 
		was based on the balance between their home and away games. Chris stated
