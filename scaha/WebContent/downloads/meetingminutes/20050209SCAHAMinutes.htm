		Plus CAHA will be putting together a Tier II schedule for Tier II Midget 
		16 &amp; 18AA.&nbsp; Will be 4 weekends a year, the weekends will be announced 
		and no SCAHA Tier II games will be scheduled for those weekends.&nbsp; 
		Between the CAHA and SCAHA schedule each Midget 16 &amp; 18AA team will have 
		2 games scheduled against every team.&nbsp; Teams must play both the SCAHA 
		and CAHA scheduled games.&nbsp; The same weekends will not have any Bantam or 
		PeeWee AA games scheduled to allow for those teams to schedule games 
		against the Norcal teams.&nbsp; In the following years CAHA will probably 
		move Bantam and PeeWee into this master CAHA statewide schedule.&nbsp; 
		Rosemary stated that this is a test program next year and if it works 
		then it will expand into other levels.&nbsp; The teams will not be allowed to 
		opt out of the games.&nbsp; Bob reiterated that if any team opts out of the 
		scheduled game, they will not be playoff eligible.&nbsp; Have also received 
		contact from some Club Presidents and coaches about helping to 
		facilitate a Tier I schedule next year and helping to facilitate Tier I 
		becoming apart of SCAHA next year.&nbsp; Looking at forming a committee to 
		look into this request.&nbsp; Rosemary added that the Midget weekends will be 
		bid on by the rinks.&nbsp; CAHA will not be running the games; they will just 
		be scheduled games.&nbsp; They are asking the rinks along with the clubs to 
		put in bids for those weekends.&nbsp; Bid packages are being sent out to 
		Presidents, Club Registrars and Tier Team Managers.&nbsp; Southwest League 
		was also discussed, CAHA and SCAHA will have a schedule, Southwest will 
		have to schedule around the schedules, and you will not be allowed to 
		opt out of games.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

		issue year this year with as soon as there is a problem parents and/or 
		coaches saying that they are going to seek legal counsel whenever a 
		problem arises.&nbsp; As soon as a person brings in discussion of legal 
		counsel, SCAHA will close line of communication, based on USA Hockey 
		bylaws.&nbsp; If a club is contacted by an Attorney, need to forward the 
		information to Louis.&nbsp; USA Hockey Bylaw 10A governs the dispute 
		resolution process, which everyone agrees to when they sign their USA 
		Hockey forms.&nbsp; If you initiate any legal proceeding for a USA Hockey 
		dispute you are immediately suspended.&nbsp; Bob also mentioned regarding 
		10A, if a player comes forward with a lawyer, we can begin charging for 
		Louis’ time resolving these issues.&nbsp; Based on 10A they are liable for 
		any and all expenses and costs, direct and indirect.&nbsp; If you want the 
		protection of the USA Hockey bylaws, then the club also needs to follow 
		the bylaws.&nbsp; The steps are listed in the USA Hockey guidebook.</span></p>

		game before an infraction that’s where you may serve your suspension and 
		then you’re free and clear. Not going to allow during the finals, teams 
		are already scheduling games to be played between the semi’s and the 
		finals.&nbsp; If a player receives a game suspension in the semi-finals, they 
		must serve the suspension in the final.&nbsp; In addition because of USA 
		Hockey rules, they will also have to serve the first game of any 
		tournament game following the game suspension.</span></p>
