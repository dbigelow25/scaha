		<h2>COMMISSIONER’S REPORT</h2>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Robert Doherty 
		informed the board that he was able to secure the meeting room for the 
		balance of this year. Our previous contact has since left the company 
		that managed this building. Robert Doherty stated he would be working on 
		securing this room for an additional year.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Robert Doherty 
		reported that at the last CAHA board meeting, it was brought up by Ed 
		Tar, the First VP of CAHA and by Charlie Fuertsch, the CAHA President 
		that the leagues should be governing Tier I as well.&nbsp; Robert Doherty 
		went on to state he was not sure what “governing” meant.&nbsp; He did not 
		believe it referred to scheduling, but rather more towards holding 
		penalty reviews, collecting rosters and possibly score sheets. He would 
		like the presidents to send him their thoughts on whether SCAHA should 
		be governing Tier I. In addition, Robert Doherty informed the board that 
		the CAHA meeting is on January 27, 2007. If there are any issues the 
		presidents would like for him to bring up they should email him by next 
		week.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Sandy Blumberg added 
		that the PWA1 Wildcats and the BNA Wolves should have an appeal in 
		motion. What concerns her is that for the Youth Council Chair to not 
		schedule a Youth Council meeting then Youth Council must not be in 
		possession of the appeals. Paula Frankel stated she had received an 
		answer from the Youth Council Chair saying they approved the PDR. Wendy 
		Goldstein stated that they are in discussions regarding the two teams.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Robert Doherty 
		informed the board that almost every sport league has some type of 
		apparel identifying board members and he would like to see presidents 
		having maybe a polo shirt with the SCAHA logo on it. Laura Ryan motioned 
		to have SCAHA purchase for $20 or less polo shirts with the SCAHA logo 
		on it for each SCAHA board member. Paula Frankel seconded. <b>MOTION 
		PASSED.</b></span></p>

		<h2>DEPUTY COMMISSIONER’S REPORT</h2>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Sandy Blumberg 
		reported that penalty reviews are way down but parent ejections are 
		still occurring. A new problem that is happening with parent ejections 
		is that score keepers are writing down parent ejection, referees are not 
		filing the reports and parents are sitting. By the time Sandy Blumberg 
		gets the report the parent has sat for 30 days without a hearing. LAHOA 
		has been informed of the problem and they are being instructed to follow 
		through with their reports. Sandy Blumberg would like the presidents to 
		educate their managers to make sure they inform them immediately of a 
		parent ejection and for the presidents to advise SCAHA that they are 
		aware of a parent ejection. </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Sandy Blumberg 
		informed the board that team penalty minutes are getting very close to 
		maximums. She would like to see the following presidents at the end of 
		the meeting: the Avalanche, the Express, the Jr. Kings, the Mariners and 
		the Wild.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Sandy Blumberg 
		reported the rulebook has been updated and posted on the web site with 
		all the rule changes regarding tiebreakers and such. The playoff 
		committee just started meeting and has awarded bids to venues. Tony Romo 
		could not be here tonight. Sandy Blumberg added she would send out an 
		email when the committee is going to meet again for those that might be 
		interested.</span></p>

		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">ICE CONVENER REPORT</span></u></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Bob Doherty informed 
		the board that Chris Carcerano could not make the meeting tonight but 
		did send out an email regarding all of the games that need to be 
		rescheduled. All Tier II games have been rescheduled and all will have 
		been played by the January 21<sup>st</sup> deadline. For A/B games some 
		were rescheduled due to “loss of ice,” resulting from CAHA weekends and 
		the SCAHA Select Camp. Other requests from A/B teams for rescheduling 
		were denied. One request from a Squirt B team was granted. The team only 
		has one goalie, and the goalie was ill with a Doctor’s note.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">There are three (3) 
		Girls’ games that have yet to be rescheduled. The home teams have until 
		January 12<sup>th</sup> to find ice (dates and times) to play these 
		games and they cannot conflict with their opponent. If the home teams do 
		not submit the information, Chris Carcerano will reschedule the game at 
		a venue of his choosing. The home team will be responsible for the cost 
		of the ice, and officials regardless of which venue is chosen. The three 
		(3) games are: Game #2352 BNA Lady Ducks (home) vs. Wildcats, game #2304 
		BNA Cal Select (home) vs. CA Bears and game #2349 Lady Ducks (home) vs. 
		Wild.</span></p>

		<h2>STATISTICIAN REPORT</h2>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">Annie Fisher distributed the team penalty minute 
		totals as of December 31, 2006 to the board. She reported she will 
		resend the penalty minute totals because she forgot to update the Squirt 
		A and Squirt B divisions.</p>

		<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><u>TREASURER’S REPORT</u></b></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">Bob Driffill distributed the financials dated

		<p class="MsoBodyText">Bob Doherty asked for a show of hands for 
		volunteers that want to take over this position. This is a CAHA/USA 
		Hockey requirement. Bob Doherty asked Larry Cahn if he would be 
		interested. Kevin Cutbertson asked if there was a detail description of 
		the responsibilities involved for the position. Bob Doherty directed 
		Kevin Cutbertson to the CAHA/USA Hockey web sites. Sandy Blumberg 
		informed the board that many of the responsibilities are already being 
		taken care of by the different directors. For example, maintain a list 
		of all certified coaches and their levels- this is already being done by 
		USA Hockey and our own Director of Member Services. Notifying all of the

		<h1><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">MEMBER SERVICES REPORT</span></h1>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">Wendy Goldstein reported the final rosters were 
		due to Turi Daniels, USA Hockey District Registrar, for Tier and for A 
		rosters to Jill Miller, CAHA Member Services, December 31, 2006. In 
		addition an email was sent to all registrars that they were to copy 
		Wendy Goldstein the A/AA rosters by January 7, 2007. Wendy Goldstein 
		informed the board that she is still missing A/AA rosters from the 
		following clubs: the Wildcats, the Lightning, the Wave, the Wild, the 
		Jr. Ice Dogs, the Eagles, the Jr. Gulls, the Saints and the Mariners. 
		The B rosters are due January 15<sup>th</sup>.</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">There are roughly 65 different coaches who 
		according to the USA Hockey web site have not certified. They will have 
		to get certified in order to remain on the roster. Many of the coaches 
		could have taken their appropriate certification in December and this 
		explains why they do not appear on USAH’s web site. Please forward their 
		copies of their coach’s card with the appropriate sticker indicating 
		their newly acquired levels. If coaches have a Level III that has 
		expired the re-certification can be done online. For those that have 
		Level I or II unfortunately they can not recertify and must be removed 
		immediately from the rosters.</p>
