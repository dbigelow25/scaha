		<p class="MsoBodyText">Bob read a statement distributed to the board 
		regarding the SCAHA Rule process. He stated the club presidents had four 
		(4) different opportunities available to them to voice their 
		proposals/opinions. The rule process started with (1)- SCAHA seeking 
		volunteers to sit on the Rules committee, (2)- the rules committee 
		meeting and working on the proposals, (3)- the club presidents reviewing 
		the revised rules sent via email prior to the annual meeting and finally 
		(4)- the actual voting of the proposed rule changes at the annual June 
		meeting. The formal process began In February and was completed in the 
		June meeting. If you or your club did not participate during this 
		process then you have only yourself to hold accountable.</p>

		<h2>DEPUTY COMMISSIONER’S REPORT</h2>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Sandy Blumberg 
		reported that the SCAHA Penalty review Committee is seeing many 
		instances of the parent ejection rule. Sandy advised the club presidents 
		to speak to their parents and advise them of this rule once again and to 
		let them know that hearings are held and fines are set. Paula F. asked 
		for clarification regarding the 30-day suspension. Sandy answered that 
		it was similar to a match penalty and only a hearing can mitigate it.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>

		<b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Referee Shadowing 
		Program:</span></b></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">Sandy informed the board of the shadowing program 
		that was recently put into place. Basically up to 12 officials have been 
		asked to be the fourth official on a game ice. Their job is to shadow 
		the game officials. Sandy stressed that the presence of the fourth 
		official has no bearing on the game and that their job would be to 
		review the performance of the game officials. This shadowing program 
		represents SCAHA’s ongoing commitment to improving the quality of its 
		game officials. And finally many complaints were being fielded regarding 
		the quality of officials at Mite/Squirt and PeeWee games and how poorly 
		they were being called. SCAHA is soliciting Tier level officials to work 
		these games and is willing to pay the difference in rates up to $25.</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">Sandy informed the board that referee-scheduling 
		fees for San Diego officials were never paid since the San Diego Referee 
		association never had a contract with us. These monies have been banked 
		and put aside for repayment to the San Diego Gulls as it represents a 
		portion of their SCAHA fees collected over the years. Sandy proposes a 
		one-time repayment to the Gulls of $1000. Laura Ryan stated her approval 
		of the proposal. Kevin C. motioned to approve a one-time repayment of 
		$1000 to the San Diego Jr. Gulls and Larri seconded. 12 voted in favor 
		and one (1) abstained. <b>MOTION PASSED</b>.</p>

		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Sandy reported that 
		unlike past seasons the Disciplinary Review Committee is operating on a 
		fixed schedule. She will require approval of the following members that 
		make up the Disciplinary Review Committee: Ann Ayres, Sandy Blumberg, 
		Laurie Boaz, Bob Driffill, Wendy Goldstein, Art Kitano, Tony Romo, 
		Rosemary Voulelikas and Tom West. Laura R. motioned to accept the 
		members as stated and Bridget H. seconded. 12 voted in favor and one (1) 
		abstained. <b>MOTION PASSED.</b></span></p>

		<p class="MsoBodyText">Bob stated that fines collected from parent 
		ejections were being added to the scholarship funds. In 2004, SCAHA 
		distributed $11,000.00 in scholarships and in 2005 SCAHA distributed 
		$15,000.00 in scholarships. This does not include the additional 
		$3,000.00 Carmen Starr College Scholarship.</p>
