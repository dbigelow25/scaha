		has with LAHOA, is LAHOA’s lack of accountability of its officials. For 
		example, officials skating with their hands in their pockets and/or 
		leaning against the boards while officiating at the younger divisions. 
		Bob Doherty reminded the board that the Executive Committee did not 
		recommend approving LAHOA’s contract and therefore asked LAHOA to 
		present its contract proposal to the SCAHA board. </span></p>

		proposal. Sandy stated she is not a big fan of SCAHA taking over all of 
		their discipline but would like to see SCAHA being able to attend their 
		discipline hearings. Sandy Blumberg stated she would be more than happy
