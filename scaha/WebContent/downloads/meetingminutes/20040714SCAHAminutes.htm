<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Bob distributed 40<sup>th</sup> 
Anniversary memo from Bay Harbor, which will be held on July 31<sup>st</sup>.&nbsp; 
Currently have scheduled 5 NHL players for autographs and exhibition game.&nbsp; Bob 
reminded everyone that the SCAHA Board needs to run SCAHA and not get involved 
in club related issues.&nbsp; If it is a club related problem SCAHA will only 
intervene when there is a big issue between clubs that cannot be resolved.&nbsp; 
Otherwise we are going to continue to push it back to the clubs; we are not 
going to run your clubs.&nbsp; The second point is zero tolerance; clubs need to 
remind families of zero tolerance.&nbsp; There was an incident during PeeWee B 
semi-final game, which involved the police and paramedics.&nbsp; The parent involved 
went through a SCAHA disciplinary review and was suspended from all USA Hockey 
activities for 1 year.&nbsp; The parent has hired and lawyer and wants to appeal the 
suspension. Both CAHA and USA Hockey have agreed with suspension.&nbsp; Sandy and Bob 
have a meeting with the lawyer on Friday.&nbsp; If not able to talk out of the 
appeal, it will be brought forth for review at the next meeting.&nbsp; In addition 
parent is banned from Easy Street Arena for life.&nbsp; It was stated that if the 
appeal is brought forth that the penalty could actually be increased.&nbsp; Sandy 
stated that there was also a second gentlemen suspended under a separate 
hearing.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Bob reviewed some of the 
items discussed at the CAHA annual meeting in June.&nbsp; CAHA is working on parental 
education program as previously discussed.&nbsp; CAHA &amp; SCAHA do not issue temporary 
coaching cards.&nbsp; USA Hockey has started a new division next year for ice hockey 
will be a non-checking division next year, Mites to Midgets.&nbsp; Ed Tar commented 
on how well Sandy Blumberg’s disciplinary reviews were handled.&nbsp; Ed did not have 
to overturn anything that SCAHA had passed and was appealed to CAHA.&nbsp; The 
penalty reviews were fair and professional and was happy that Sandy would be 
heading up the penalty review again this year.&nbsp; USA Hockey legal counsel brought 
up that they have a big issue with parents going directly to USA Hockey and not 
going through proper channels.&nbsp; Need to let parents and team managers know that 
if they have a problem with anything the avenue is club, league, CAHA and then 
USA Hockey, not USA Hockey directly.&nbsp; California again won the Chicago Showcase. 
CAHA is striving to improve the communication between coaches and will actively 
push the Ace program.&nbsp; It is a SCAHA mandate that every SCAHA club have an Ace 
Coaching Coordinator.&nbsp; New to the CAHA Board from SCAHA are Nick Besheer from 
the Wild, Lou Pacella from LA Hockey Club and Rosemary Voulelikas from the Jr. 
Kings and Bob.&nbsp; Most of the committee members stayed the same.&nbsp; Melissa 
Fitzgerald remains head of the Youth Council.&nbsp; Another big point that Chris and 
Bob will work, cannot be brought to the Presidents for a vote.&nbsp; It is a mandate 
from USA Hockey to CAHA and down to us girls teams will be added to the schedule 
and the games that the boys play against the girls will count toward the boy’s 
seasons standing.&nbsp; They will not count towards the girls because the girls 
actually play as Tier teams.&nbsp; The games will be mandatory.&nbsp; Issue discussed 
regarding parent suspension and a SCAHA club, there is a parent who was banned 
from CAHA and USA Hockey for 5 years.&nbsp; CAHA discussed what CAHA will do if CAHA 
puts a discipline and ban is ignored.&nbsp; The individual who was banned for 5 years 
has ignored the ban and is active with a SCAHA club.&nbsp; CAHA is working on an 
ethics committee and what to do with the individual and they discussed potential 
club fines.&nbsp; Recommend if you have someone who has been either suspended by CAHA 
or USA Hockey do not let them involve your club, some of the numbers that CAHA 
was talking about for fines were substantial fines.&nbsp; CAHA has developed the 
Carmen Starr award for volunteers, for someone who has gone above and beyond the 
norm.&nbsp; The first recipient was Carmen Starr.&nbsp; CAHA has ceased the use of travel 
permit.&nbsp; If you are going to travel out of state you no longer have to get a 
permit or notify CAHA to travel.&nbsp; Still need to report the games to CAHA.&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Also discussed at Youth 
Council and CAHA the California Tier League and Tier Scheduling.&nbsp; Bob and Pete 
Toth (Norcal President) have to come up with a statewide Tier Schedule.&nbsp; We have 
to have Norcal weekends where we travel and north and weekends where Norcal will 
travel south.&nbsp; If SCAHA and Norcal can agree that schedule will be sanctioned by 
CAHA and will become a mandatory schedule for Tier II.&nbsp; If you play in the 
Southwest league and play a certain team and you don’t want to travel to 
Northern California to play the same team it will be considered a forfeit for 
your team.&nbsp; It must be an equitable schedule.&nbsp; Going to try and have worked out 
by August board meeting.&nbsp; Chris is still missing some final team declarations 
and ice slots.&nbsp; </span></p>
