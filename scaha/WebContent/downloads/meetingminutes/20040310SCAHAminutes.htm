one of their players would not be playoff eligible, due to not enough SCAHA 
games played. Discussion followed regarding why player was ineligible. Rick Kent

discussion prior to motion. Question was asked, how many players have requested 
playoff eligibility waivers. 3 players requested waivers, which were reviewed by 
the Executive Board. Two were approved and this one was denied. One that was 
approved was due to mistakes made by club, not rostered properly by the club for 
his first 7 games. He did have 12 games. The club was fined and put on 
probation. The second player approved was moved from one team to another within 
the same club and was short one game due to our schedule and byes. Rick Kent

Gulls reported that each year the San Diego Gulls and La Jolla Jaguars have had 
included in their SCAHA fees an approximate $5.00 per player fee paid to LAHOA. 
Because their teams do not fall under LAHOA, the fee is not paid to LAHOA. 
Estimate average cost per team is $75.00, requesting that this year these clubs 
be reimbursed for these fees. Laura Ryan moved for the two San Diego area teams, 
6 teams La Jolla $450.00, 8 teams Gulls $600.00 for a total of $1,050.00 be 
reimbursed for this past season of fees. If no resolution this upcoming season, 
do not charge the $75.00 per team fee for the upcoming season. Larri Woertler 
requested amendment to motion: Reimbursement is at $75.00 per each registered 
non-tier 1 teams.<b> MOTION WAS SECONDED AND CARRIED.</b></font>&nbsp;<br>
