  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Tony reported that there 
  were three appeals to be reviewed.&nbsp; The majority of the appeals were regarding 
  playoff eligibility.&nbsp; Also an appeal from a South Coast Sabers Coach 
  requesting a revision to the schedule or in lieu of not revising the schedule 
  adding additional teams to the division for the playoffs.&nbsp; The Executive Board 
  denied all of the requests.&nbsp; </span></p>

  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">1st appeal - A player from 
  Sun Devils requesting to be playoff eligible.&nbsp; Dave Monshaw presented the 
  appeal on behalf of the player who stopped playing for the Wave on 10/26/02.&nbsp; 
  Joined the Sun Devils in December, release date is based on when signed by new 
  team not when player left first team.&nbsp; Based on rule 32.05 states that player 
  that moves after 10/31 will not be CAHA A championship eligible.&nbsp; They were 
  not aware that this also meant that they would not be SCAHA playoff eligible. 
  They joined the team thinking that they could play until the end of the season 
  including playoffs.&nbsp; Wendy Goldstein brought to the attention of Dave that 
  CAHA playoffs do include SCAHA playoffs.&nbsp; In addition Curt summarized email 
  previously sent regarding the release of this player. Originally request was 
  for cut so that player could move laterally.&nbsp; Club would not cut player due to 
  this causing further issues.&nbsp; Release was requested on 10/27 and offered to 
  grant release once they had a receiving club.&nbsp; The receiving club was not 
  obtained until several weeks later.&nbsp; At the time release was given 12/17, 
  there was also a signed letter stating that they understood that their son 
  might not be eligible for playoffs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

  His request is to revise the schedule to move 2 games to even up the schedule

  Mites, &amp; Midget 16A &amp; 16B.&nbsp; It was worked out for the Midgets and a lot of 
  people were trying to accomplish for the Mites.&nbsp; It was agreed upon that only

  available to all clubs. Included in the packets was information regarding 
  cross-ice program.&nbsp; District is seriously pushing the cross-ice program.&nbsp; Also 
  included within the packets information regarding D&amp;O insurance, development 
  guides for each division regarding age appropriate skill development.&nbsp; A 
  majority of the earlier part of the meeting had to do with the USA Hockey

  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Motion made for cross-ice 
  was withdrawn.&nbsp; They did give the affiliates, which includes CAHA a very 
  strong edict to begin to implement some type of program that would begin to 
  deemphasize the competition and some of the current things that are happening 
  with Mites.&nbsp; Trying to move more towards cross-ice program and also travel 
  restrictions with Squirts.&nbsp; Believe that they are requiring that by the 
  2005/2006 season.&nbsp; Discussion followed regarding the Mite and Squirt 
  situation.&nbsp; The district is trying to cut down on the travel for these 
  divisions.&nbsp; Tony stated that he doesn’t believe that they are going to mandate 
  these policies, they want to see CAHA put some policy similar into effect, 
  whether it’s grandfathered in for current players and new players begin with 
  cross ice.&nbsp; They just want to see these new programs started.&nbsp; Willing to 
  offer grant money, which will come from USA Hockey – Pacific District.&nbsp; In 
  addition CAHA is slating some money to start some cross-ice program to build 
  up the Mite program, so you can start the kids and then ease them into travel 
  hockey.&nbsp; Sandy stated that in the end they asked the affiliates to come back 
  with their proposals for approval within the next few months.&nbsp; Tony stated 
  that they’re not saying don’t have Mites travel but maybe only have your Mites 
  and Squirts travel once or twice.&nbsp; Whether or not it goes through will be up 
  to the entire CAHA board.&nbsp; </span></p>

  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">From the CAHA meeting 
  Sandy reported that they did relinquish the STOP patch program, so it is now 
  the responsibility of the league to facilitate the STOP patches.&nbsp; Screening is 
  every five years for screening and abuse.&nbsp; Need to have a database set-up to 
  ensure that everyone is screened.&nbsp; Larri Woertler asked if clubs are going to 
  be advised of who needs to be rescreened.&nbsp; Curt stated that Steve Laing will 
  be putting something on the CAHA website which will show who is currently 
  screened.</span></p>

  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Larry Bruyere inquired if 
  the tryout date will be changing.&nbsp; Sandy stated that it died early, didn’t 
  pass.&nbsp; It did go to a vote.&nbsp; Tryout dates will remain the same.&nbsp; About half 
  had previously stated they would like to see the tryouts change if AAA began 1<sup>st</sup> 
  two weeks of May, 2<sup>nd</sup> half of May AA, then A &amp; B starting in June.&nbsp; 
  Some stated that they didn’t want it changed at all to give everyone a break.&nbsp; 
  Curt requested that it be opened up for discussion.&nbsp; Tony stated that CAHA 
  would not meet again until April and won’t be able to change in April because 
  Ice will be booked for July, unless you think that in April you would be able 
  to get your ice in thirty days and be ready to go for tryouts.&nbsp; The CAHA vote 
  was taken late in the day people had to leave for flights, it was a 7 to 6 
  vote.&nbsp; Discussion followed regarding pros and cons of moving tryout dates.&nbsp; An 
  informal poll was taken of preference for change in tryout dates.&nbsp; 14 clubs 
  voted May; 8 voted for June or July.&nbsp; Curt Castagna made the motion to have 
  SCAHA Board make recommendation to CAHA to reevaluate the situation either at 
  April meeting or before to allow May 1<sup>st</sup> tryouts for Tier I for 
  Tier II tryouts to begin after May 15<sup>th</sup> and for A&amp;B to start after 
  June 1<sup>st</sup>.&nbsp; Ron White seconded the Motion.&nbsp; </span></p>

  discussion be held prior to the vote.&nbsp; Dave inquired if you want this to begin 
  this year or start next year.&nbsp; Dave requested that an amendment be added to 
  the motion to begin the earlier tryout dates for at least a year from now.&nbsp; 
  Tony requested that the motion be read; Curt stated that he wanted to make a 
  slight amendment to the original motion.&nbsp; Motion was made to make a 
  recommendation to CAHA that they take a position on this with our vote on or 
  before their April meeting to allow Tier I tryouts to begin after the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
  Saturday in May, Tier II tryouts to begin 2 weeks following that and A&amp;B 
  tryouts to follow in June.&nbsp; Dave Contis Motioned to amend the motion to make 
  the change effective 1 year from now.&nbsp; Curt declined the amendment.&nbsp; Ron White 
  seconded the Motion.&nbsp; Request was made to call for the vote.&nbsp; Dave stated that 
  he could call for discussion prior to the vote.&nbsp; Bob Doherty stated that he 
  doesn’t know if ice will be available, he can’t vote without going back to 
  rink to check ice availability.&nbsp; Tony requested that we defer the vote while 
  we handle other matters.&nbsp; Curt agreed to defer at this time.&nbsp; </span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Sandy reported that from 
  the CAHA meeting that it does appear that CAHA is moving towards taking over 
  scheduling of Tier II hockey in order to accommodate all the teams in state 
  playing 100% of the teams in state. Looks like it will be four round robin 
  weekends to be held throughout the season.&nbsp; Pam Levin stated that what was 
  voted upon and passed was that CAHA would adopt a format similar to the 
  Southwest Hockey template with 4 weekends throughout the season to accommodate 
  Tier II and probably Tier I depending on how many teams in that division.&nbsp; If 
  CAHA chooses to provide reduced schedule 10 games, 12 games or none at all 
  depending on what this group wants.&nbsp; But the only question about the proposal 
  was getting enough ice in Southern California, which appears that this problem 
  has been solved by breaking up divisions.&nbsp; Proposal was put together based on 
  the assumption of the same amount of teams this year.&nbsp; It would be difficult 
  to have some of the larger divisions at one facility, because that facility 
  would have to turn away all of their other activities.&nbsp; The plan is to use a 
  few facilities in the same general vicinity to accommodate a division.&nbsp; This 
  will start being put into place with the Tier II teams.&nbsp; Participation is 
  mandatory.&nbsp; Sandy stated that this would also include penalty review and all 
  those other things.&nbsp; Question was asked what will happen if a team drops from 
  Tier level.&nbsp; Tony responded that a decision will need to be made if we will 
  accommodate the drop or let them know that if they do drop that we will not be 
  able to accommodate them, one or the other, we had some teams who wanted to 
  drop this year and we did not accommodate them.&nbsp; </span></p>

  they are hosting the Pacific District regional so they are automatically in 
  the Pacific District and they elected not to participate in the State 
  Playoffs.&nbsp; Discussion followed regarding this as a USA Hockey Pacific District 
  rule.&nbsp; Pam Levin stated that the support must be in writing and submitted to 
  Ed Tar.&nbsp; Tony responded that the full board could put in writing to support 
  Bay Harbor’s appeal and in addition also support the Mariners.&nbsp; If we want to 
  make the recommendation as a full board we can do that and draft a letter and 
  send as a resolution by the SCAHA Board of Directors that we think it’s 
  appropriate for them to participate.&nbsp; Larry Bruyere made the Motion that this 
  Board support Bay Harbor and the Mariners to be eligible to go to the 
  playoffs.&nbsp; <b>MOTION WAS SECONDED AND CARRIED.</b></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Curt reported that we 
  currently have a balance sheet showing $236,000 of assets in the three bank 
  accounts.&nbsp; The profit and loss is showing a net income of $34,000 but we still 
  have $32,000 of expenses for this season. That will bring us into the end of 
  the season if everything goes right around $205,000 in the account.&nbsp; Last 
  month it was reported that discussions should be done of how best to reinvest 
  into the league.&nbsp; The reconciliation is ongoing of the four accounts, which 
  were remaining from the Jr. Kings program.&nbsp; Currently being completed should 
  be done probably next month.&nbsp; Doesn’t have all the details from the Accountant 
  to give out at this time, but are currently trying to reconcile the monies 
  that were in those accounts that were not on the SCAHA tax returns for the 
  past 3 or 4 seasons.&nbsp; Those monies will have to be reconciled so those tax 
  returns can be completed.&nbsp; More information will be available next month.&nbsp; Pam 
  Levin asked what the cost would be for SCAHA playoffs.&nbsp; Tony responded $1,000 
  for each team, guaranteed 3 games.&nbsp; Bob Levin stated that CAHA would be $1050 
  for A&amp;B.&nbsp; </span></p>

  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Curt distributed an idea 
  for a resolution for review.&nbsp; The resolution is a proposal for returning 
  monies to SCAHA member clubs from 1997 to 2002 period and establishes a point 
  structure.&nbsp; Discussion followed regarding the proposal.&nbsp; There is concern that 
  we are faced with a situation with the IRS where we are going to have to 
  evaluate any penalties we may have with the funds that weren’t accounted for 
  in the four former accounts.&nbsp; We’re not sure where we stand with that right 
  now.&nbsp; Dave Monshaw inquired if it would be possible that we could end up 
  negative with the IRS penalties and fines.&nbsp; Curt responded that we have 
  currently spent $9,200 of the $10,000 for the reconciliation to date.&nbsp; This 
  doesn’t include penalties or fines, which we will try to appeal.&nbsp; To save 
  money we have used a bookkeeper to reconcile versus using the accountant.&nbsp; The 
  process is almost completed, and then it will be a matter of going to the IRS 
  and appealing to them over the last 4 years.&nbsp; We won’t be able to amend the 
  tax returns, so we are going to have to go back and explain the situation.&nbsp; 
  Valerie Broadhead stated that we should wait until later in the year until the 
  IRS ruling has been received. It was suggested that the monies be returned to 
  the clubs as an overpayment prior to the IRS penalties being levied.&nbsp; Larry 
  Bruyere made the Motion to have each club take back to their membership and 
  revisit the proposal for March vote.&nbsp; <b>MOTION WAS SECONDED AND CARRIED</b>.&nbsp;

  Saturday in May and A&amp;B after Memorial Weekend for this Board to take a vote

  motion.&nbsp; Teri Bain seconded Curt’s motion.&nbsp; Dave stated that he wanted to put 
  in a second motion, which would be the same as Curt’s with the exception that 
  it would be effective with the 2004 season.&nbsp; If there is a second would like 
  that motion to go next and then have a vote on that.&nbsp; If we find that it’s 
  14-3, 14-4, Dave would withdraw the motion and think he could still 
  filibuster.&nbsp; The reason for this is if the vote is 13-12 maybe Curt would 
  reconsider and give a year.&nbsp; If the vote stays 14-8 then Dave would like a

  CAHA and find out if they will agree to make the change and then come back to 
  the board for another vote at the next meeting, which will give clubs time to 
  go back and see if ice is available.&nbsp; Further discussion followed regarding 
  the vote.&nbsp; Curt stated that he doesn’t have a problem going forward with 
  sending a note to CAHA asking them to reevaluate based on a straw poll that 
  was taken tonight and they could take a full vote of the CAHA Board and make a 
  decision consistent with this motion.&nbsp; </span></p>
