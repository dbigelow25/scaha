		<h2>COMMISSIONER’S REPORT</h2>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Robert Doherty 
		reminded the presidents of the USA Hockey screening program. If a coach 
		was not screened by September 30 he or she can not coach until he/she 
		appears on the compliance list. Any violations will be brought to the 
		SCAHA disciplinary committee.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Robert Doherty 
		informed the board of the status of the season with regards to the “New 
		Standards of Play Emphasis” and stated that the games so far appear to 
		be running smoothly. He added that SCAHA will continue to track the 
		penalties and asked if there was any issues or concerns regarding 
		penalties in the first weekend of regular season play. Wendy Goldstein 
		informed the board she received an email from Annie Fisher, SCAHA 
		Statistician informing her of 4 match penalties and a total of 262 game 
		suspensions to date. This includes the preseason weekends of play as 
		well as the first regular season weekend of play. These penalties 
		reflect coach suspensions, player suspensions, 5 penalties in a game 
		player suspensions, etc. Bob Doherty stated that all in all it appears 
		that the penalties have begun to subside, as he has not received any 
		emails regarding penalties after the first weekend of regular season 
		play.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Bob Doherty informed 
		the board the bids for the SCAHA Select Camp would be sent out to all 
		the rinks. He reported that SCAHA has been in communication with the two 
		rinks that hosted it last year. If SCAHA does not receive bids in a 
		timely fashion from other rinks they will proceed in negotiating with 
		last year’s hosts. LeAnn Doherty and Tim Fahringer will again chair the 
		Select Camps. Bob Doherty reiterated that SCAHA needs volunteers for the 
		Select camp for on-ice and off-ice coaches.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Bob Doherty informed 
		the board Tony Romo has graciously accepted to chair the SCAHA Playoff 
		committee again this season. Bob Doherty reiterated the need for 
		volunteers for all venues. Home clubs at host venues will be expected to 
		work the venue.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Bob Doherty reported 
		to the board of an idea that was proposed regarding having a 
		SCAHA/Presidents’ Night. He asked the board if they might be interested 
		in this and for their feedback.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Bob Doherty opened 
		for discussion the tryout dates for next season and subsequent years. 
		CAHA has changed the tryout dates to start on May 15<sup>th</sup> and 
		the leagues have the jurisdiction to decide on the exact dates for the 
		Tier I, Tier II and A/B levels. He reiterated that the presidents should 
		be reviewing and voting on dates that will be used for subsequent years. 
		Laura Ryan motioned to accept the following tryout dates for the 
		2007-2008 season and Joe Conrad seconded. The Tier I Tryouts to start 
		the first weekend of June, the Tier II tryouts to start the second 
		weekend in June and the A/B tryouts to start the fourth weekend in June. 
		For the 2007-2008 season this translates to Tier I (June 1<sup>st</sup>), 
		Tier II (June 8<sup>th</sup>) and A/B (June 22<sup>nd</sup>). 15 voted 
		in favor and 5 opposed. <b>MOTION CARRIED</b>.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">Bob Doherty reported the Champs program was 
		started with the intent that it would not incur a cost to SCAHA. At the 
		time SCAHA estimated that 600 - 700 players would participate and the 
		Kings and the Ducks generously agreed to sponsor this program for us. 
		The good news is the program has grown beyond our expectations and 
		presently we have 1,100 players participating in the program. 
		Unfortunately, SCAHA does not have any additional money allocated to 
		accommodate this growth. Larri Woertler motioned to allocate $5,000 from 
		the budget to the Champs program and Tom West seconded. <b>MOTION PASSED</b>.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">Bob Doherty stated to the board that a Division 
		meeting was held to determine the viability of certain teams’ in certain 
		divisions. A few teams were contacted and were urged to move. Bob 
		Doherty stated that he would like to see this committee formed every 
		year and to have volunteers on it beside members of the SCAHA Executive 
		committee. In addition, this process next year will be quicker and the 
		teams will be notified of their move requirement earlier.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
		<h2>DEPUTY COMMISSIONER’S REPORT</h2>

		all of the presidents containing the various fundraising programs

		skate, intermission skates and post game skates. The proceeds from the
