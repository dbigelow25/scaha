		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Bob reminded the 
		board that the SCAHA Pre-Select Camp was mandated by CAHA and that it 
		was never a line item in this year’s budget. Bob stated that we will

		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Bob stated the SCAHA 
		Pre-Select camp that occurred on January 8<sup>th</sup> and 9th went as 
		well as expected considering SCAHA had a short time frame from which to

		with alternates. SCAHA will not be sponsoring the $90 CAHA fee for those 
		players selected to the CAHA Select Camp as they did last season. Bob 
		advised that if a player does not remit the $90 CAHA fee in time, the 
		player’s spot in the CAHA Select camp would be given away.</span></p>

		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Discussion followed 
		regarding the format for the SCAHA Pre-Select camp next season. Charlie 
		Knotts volunteered to head up the committee to oversee the execution of 
		the Pre-Select camp for next season. Larry Cahn suggested the camp 
		should be a one day camp with 6 evaluators throughout the day. Bob 
		suggested next year’s committee would review all possible formats and 
		make its recommendations.</span></p>

		<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><u>North Valley Tigers:</u></b></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText">Bob explained to the board that the North Valley

		<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial">DEPUTY COMMISSIONER 
		REPORT</span></u></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Sandy Blumberg 
		explained the SCAHA Playoff Eligibility Rule 34.09 to the board stating 
		that during last year’s rule committee it was proposed and voted on by 
		the SCAHA board to change the number of regular season league games to 
		10 games from the 6 games of previous seasons. Wendy explained that the 
		rule changed in order to stop the movement of players from one team onto 
		another team late in the season. The second team was usually a playoff 
		bound team. By changing the rule to 10 league games it was felt that it 
		would stop the addition of ‘last minute ringers” on a team.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Discussions’ 
		followed regarding this season’s shortened calendar game schedule and 
		how there were only 9 regular season game weekends left after the close 
		of final roster. It was noted that some divisions even had possibly only 
		7 regular season games left. In addition it was stated that even if a 
		player were added before 12/31/04 this season, he would still not be 
		able to get his 10 games in with his team and thus be playoff 
		ineligible. In the past, when there were 22 weekends of scheduled 
		regular season games, players would be able to get their 10 games in and 
		qualify for post season play. Curt Castagna motioned to amend the SCAHA 
		Playoff Rule 34.09 for this season only because of the calendar year to 
		require players to have played 6 regular season league games and 10 
		overall games in order to be playoff eligible. Jerry Wilhite seconded. 
		15 voted in favor, two voted against and one abstained. <b>THE MOTION

		and last year at this same time the balance sheet shows a difference of&nbsp; 
		-9%. Curt also stated that this year’s Pre-select camp was never 
		budgeted. The revenues generated were about $12,400 and the expenses 
		were about $8,400 for a net income of about $4,000. Larri Woertler 
		motioned to accept the SCAHA Pre-Select budget as a line item into the 
		SCAHA budget and that $3,000 from the net income of the SCAHA Pre-Select 
		is distributed to players, in other words SCAHA is to pay $60 of the 
		CAHA Select fee for those players who advanced to the CAHA camp. LeAnn
