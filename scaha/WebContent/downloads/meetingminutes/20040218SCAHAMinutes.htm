<font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Tony reported that the 
Championship games will be held at the Long Beach Ice Arena. Division with four

<font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Semi-finals will 
be held in Lakewood. Playoff fee this year will be $900. If you have teams that 
are in, need to submit their playoff fee. Teams that are on the fence will have 
their checks held. Deadline date for submitting fee is March 8<sup>th</sup>. The 
fee will cover 1<sup>st</sup> round, semi-finals and finals. Will not cover CAHA 
playoff fees.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">CAHA A &amp; B 
playoffs will be held in San Jose. Hopefully next year will be held in Southern 
California.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<br>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Jerry Wilhite reported 
that the excess funds previously reported in SCAHA accounts will be available to 
benefit the league. As head of the committee looking into way to have the funds 
best benefit the league, they have come up with a few ideas. 207 players will be 
aging out and only 152 new mite players. Over 600 players will be aging out over 
next two years. At this time the league needs to focus on how to get more kids 
in the league how to promote youth hockey in Southern California for all clubs.

&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">One suggestion was to 
put a portion of the money into an endowment, the monies earned from the 
endowment could be used for the scholarship program. </font>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">In addition some 
of the obstacles to getting players into the league are: 1. Money; 2. Time &amp; 3. 
Commitment. It is also felt that the league is not being promoted. Suggestion 
was made to go to Ducks &amp; Kings to assist with promoting youth hockey for all 
clubs. </font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Additional suggestion 
was to turn the Mite &amp; Squirt B season into 2 mini seasons. Each season would be 
10 weeks long. This would lower the cost and also allow players to have less 
time commitment. </font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Above was 
previously presented and approved by Executive Board. Discussion followed 
regarding the Mite &amp; Squirt teams. Ron White moved that it be tabled until March 
in order to review cost involved. <b>MOTION WAS SECONDED AND CARRIED. </b>

COORDINATOR REPORT</u></b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<font face="Verdana" size="2" style="line-height: 1.3em">Larry reported that the 
scheduling committee met and is suggesting that SCAHA no longer schedule Tier 
games. Next year the schedule will only have 20 weeks due to Labor Day later 
this year, Christmas and New Years fall on Saturday and also black out weekends 
for PreSelect, Select and holiday weekends. With tryouts and declarations 
earlier this year, should be able to put together schedule earlier this year. 
Larry Bruyere moved that once Exhibition is done and team declarations are in 
then we distribute the Master Schedule. Some teams will be requesting changes; 
change must be made at least one week in advance and mutual. Requesting team 
must pay cost. If necessary Arbitrator will step in (most likely Ice Convenor) 
if no resolution then requesting team would forfeit. If the requesting team is 
the visiting team, they will be responsible for cost of ice for home team. SCAHA 
will not be scheduling Tier games. <b>MOTION WAS SECONDED AND CARRIED.</b>
