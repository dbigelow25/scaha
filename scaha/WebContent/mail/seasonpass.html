Hello :FIRSTNAME: :LASTNAME:,<p/>

Thank you for Registering :PFIRST: :PLAST: for the upcoming :SEASON:. <p/>

Below are two numbers you will need have with you during the try-out process.  

<table cellpadding="5" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" cellspacing="0" width="90%">
	<tr>
		<td width="40%"><b>USA Hockey Number:</b></td>
		<td style="text-align:left;font-size:14pt;">:USAHNUM:</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td width="40%"><b>SCAHA Season Pass:</b></td>
		<td style="text-align:left;font-size:14pt;">:SCAHANUM:</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
<br/>
Please make sure you bring this e-mail with you to all try-outs. You will need both these numbers to electronically sign 
any LOI a participating Club may offer your child.<p/>

:BCSENTENCE:<p/>

Our new Electronic LOI process saves people from handling over the 12,000 LOI documents that get generated each season. 
This also saves in excess of $5k in annual printing costs to produce these forms.<p/>

If you have not done so already, please go to <a href='http://www.iscaha.com/scaha/manageUSAHockey.xhtml'>SCAHA Member Creation</a> 
to generate an active SCAHA membership pass for every family member involved in SCAHA.<p/>

Best Regards,<p/>

The iScaha Team.<br/>
