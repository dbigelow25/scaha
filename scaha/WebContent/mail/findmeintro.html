	<div style="font-weight: normal;">
		<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;</span>
	</div>
	<div style="font-weight: normal;">
		<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 13px;">Both
			of these things need to be done prior to attending tryouts this year.
			&nbsp; So its important that you take care of this now.</span>
	</div>
	<div style="font-weight: normal;">
		<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;</span>
	</div>
	<div style="font-weight: normal;">
		<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 13px;">To
			get things started, you will use the same SCAHA account created last year. You can log onto your account by visiting <a

	<div style="font-weight: normal;">
		<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 13px;"><br></span>
	</div>
	<div style="font-weight: normal;">
		<ol>
			<li>Manage your profile (pretty self-explanatory).&nbsp;</li>
			<li>Register your family &nbsp;members for the upcoming SCAHA
				season.</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<div style="font-weight: normal;">
		<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;</span>

	</div>
	<div style="font-weight: normal;">
		<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 13px;">After
			you have dialed that in, we want you to focus on the second thing at
			your disposal.. which is registering family members for the upcoming
			season. &nbsp;This can also be you if you plan on being a Manager,
			Volunteer, or Coach.</span>
	</div>
	<div style="font-weight: normal;">
		<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;</span>

	<div style="font-weight: normal;">
		<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;</span>

				, log in.. and select Register for SCAHA in the "My Actions" menu
			</li>

				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>Enter the
				number, and click Next and follow the instructions. &nbsp;</li>
			<li>Once complete,
				we have captured all the USA Hockey information along with
				generating a 5 digit Season Pass code. &nbsp;This is an important

		<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 13px;">That
			is it. &nbsp; This <span style="font-weight: bold;">SCAHA
				Season Pass Code</span> will be used to identify your child at any SCAHA
			club tryout, and will be used to electronically sign any LOI that may
			be offered. &nbsp; Treat it like a personal PIN. &nbsp;It identifies
			your player(s) to the SCAHA system.
