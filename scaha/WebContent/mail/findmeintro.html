		<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 13px;">This
			year, SCAHA is doing away with Paper LOI’s and is moving to an all
			ONLINE LOI process. &nbsp; In order to go paperless, we need you to
			perform two tasks.</span>
	</div>
	<div style="font-weight: normal;">
		<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;</span>
	</div>
	<div style="font-weight: normal;">
		<ol>
			<li>Register for USA Hockey Membership NOW for the 2014/15
				season</li>
			<li>Register each player with SCAHA and receive a 5 digit Season
				Pass Code.</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<div style="font-weight: normal;">
		<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;</span>
	</div>
	<div style="font-weight: normal;">
		<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 13px;">Both
			of these things need to be done prior to attending tryouts this year.
			&nbsp; So its important that you take care of this now.</span>
	</div>
	<div style="font-weight: normal;">
		<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;</span>
	</div>
	<div style="font-weight: normal;">
		<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 13px;">To
			get things started, SCAHA has already setup user accounts for all
			known SCAHA families. You can log onto your account by visiting <a
			href="http://www.iscaha.com">http://www.iscaha.com</a>.
		</span>
	</div>
	<div style="font-weight: normal;">
		<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 13px;"><br></span>
	</div>
	<div style="font-weight: normal;">
		<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 13px;">You
			use your e-mail (the one you received this memo on) as both your
			usercode and password. &nbsp;You enter this in the upper right corner
			of the site to gain access to membership information.&nbsp;</span>Once you
		login, you will see a "My Actions" &nbsp;menu button appear along the
		top. &nbsp; You have basically two things at your disposal:
	</div>
	<div style="font-weight: normal;">
		<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;</span>
	</div>
	<div style="font-weight: normal;">
		<ol>
			<li>Manage your profile (pretty self-explanatory).&nbsp;</li>
			<li>Register your family &nbsp;members for the upcoming SCAHA
				season.</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<div style="font-weight: normal;">
		<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;</span>
	</div>
	<div style="font-weight: normal;">
		<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 13px;">We
			ask that you log in and check out the profile that we set up for you
			and make any changes to address, phone, e-mail, or password, etc...</span>
	</div>
	<div style="font-weight: normal;">
		<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 13px;">After
			you have dialed that in, we want you to focus on the second thing at
			your disposal.. which is registering family members for the upcoming
			season. &nbsp;This can also be you if you plan on being a Manager,
			Volunteer, or Coach.</span>
	</div>
	<div style="font-weight: normal;">
		<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;</span>
	</div>
	<div style="font-weight: normal;">
		<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 13px;">Now..
			we need you to perform the following steps to complete both the USA
			Hockey and SCAHA membership registration for this season’</span>
	</div>
	<div style="font-weight: normal;">
		<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;</span>
	</div>
	<div style="font-weight: normal;">
		<ol>
			<li>Go to USA Hockey (<a
				href="https://www.usahockeyregistration.com/login_input.action">https://www.usahockeyregistration.com/login_input.action</a>)
				and register your player(s) for the upcoming season.
			</li>
			<li>Make sure you have a copy of the 14 digit number that is
				generated by USAHockey - you will need this below.</li>
			<li>Go to (<a href="http://www.iscaha.com">http://www.iscaha.com</a>)
				, log in.. and select Register for SCAHA in the "My Actions" menu
			</li>
			<li>You will see a place to type in that USA Hockey number.
				&nbsp;</li>
			<li>Enter the
				number, and click Next and follow the instructions. &nbsp;</li>
			<li>Once complete,
				we have captured all the USA Hockey information along with
				generating a 5 digit Season Pass code. &nbsp;This is an important
				number.</li>
			<li>You will receive
				an e-mail with all this information, and you will want to print off
				a copy and save it for SCAHA tryouts.</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<div style="font-weight: normal;">
		<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 13px;"><br></span>
	</div>
	<div>
		<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 13px;">That
			is it. &nbsp; This <span style="font-weight: bold;">SCAHA
				Season Pass Code</span> will be used to identify your child at any SCAHA
			club tryout, and will be used to electronically sign any LOI that may
			be offered. &nbsp; Treat it like a personal PIN. &nbsp;It identifies
			your player(s) to the SCAHA system.

	</div>
	<div style="font-weight: normal;">
		<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;</span>

	<div style="font-weight: normal;">
		<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 13px;">If
			you have any questions or comments or cannot log in with your e-mail
			address as both &nbsp;your usercode and password, please do not
			hesitate to contact David Bigelow at dbigelow@the-rinks.com or Rob
			Foster at lahockeyfan2@yahoo.com.</span>

	<div style="font-weight: normal;">

	</div>
	<div style="font-weight: normal;">
		<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 13px;">We
			need all our collective club members to be registered prior to the
			start of tryouts. &nbsp;To see how your club is doing.. please visit
			the home page of <a href="http://www.iscaha.com">www.iscaha.com</a>.
			&nbsp;There is a table on each club’s registration rate. &nbsp;Lets
			see which club can get all their members from last season to register
			for this year.
