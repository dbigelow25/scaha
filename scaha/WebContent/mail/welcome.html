Hello :FIRSTNAME: :LASTNAME:,<p/>

Welcome the new SCAHA iSite system.   To get to our website just visit<p/>

http://www.iscaha.com/scaha<p/>

Your login credentials are: 
<ul>
<li>username: :USERNAME:</li>
<li>password: :PASSWORD:</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Please ensure that you register every hockey playing member of your family with USA Hockey for the upcoming season, 
you will need the USA Hockey registration number to become an active member for the SCAHA 2014/15 season. <p/>

Active registered members receive a <b>unique season pass</b> number that identifies you to the SCAHA world.  
This number is needed for SCAHA Club tryouts and is the only way to sign an electronic LOI with the club.<p/>

Our new Electronic LOI process saves people from handling over the 12 thousand LOI documents that get generated each season. 
This also saves in excess of $5k in annual printing costs to produce these forms.<p/>

Once you register your family members at USA Hockey, please go to <a href='http://www.iscaha.com/scaha/manageUSAHockey.xhtml'>SCAHA Member Creation</a> 
to generate an active SCAHA membership pass for this upcoming season.<p/>

Best Regards,<p/>

The iScaha Team.
